<h6 id="remove-heat-release-rate-limiter-in-combustion-model">Remove heat release rate limiter in combustion model</h6>
<p>In past versions of FDS, a bound was set to limit the amount of heat that could be released in a given cell over a given time step. The bound was approximately 2000 kW/m<sup>3</sup>. Without this bound, numerical instabilities could occur if too much heat was added to a grid cell too quickly. Physically, it is impossible to for fuel and oxygen to react and produce such large amounts of energy in a given cell, but since we used a simple infinitely fast chemistry model, it could happen in the model. Now, we handle the combustion chemistry in such a way as to control the mixing time and prevent such large releases. Thus, the input parameters HRRPUV_AVERAGE and HRRPUA_SHEET, which allowed the user to set the upper bound on the heat release rate of a given cell, are not needed and have been removed.</p>
<h6 id="set-default-radiant-fraction-for-various-fuels">Set default radiant fraction for various fuels</h6>
<p>The default radiative fraction in FDS has been 0.35; that is, the fire is assumed to radiate 35% of its energy. Most users simply accept this value because the literature does not provide an extensive database of these values. Radiative fraction is not an intrinsic property of a fuel; it varies with the size and environment of the fire. However, some fuels, like methane (natural gas), are known to radiate approximately 20%; and some fuels, like heptane and heavier hydrocarbons, radiate approximately 40%. Starting with FDS 6.3.0, certain select fuels like METHANE and HEPTANE will have default values of RADIATIVE_FRACTION other than 35%. METHANE and the alcohols will be 20%; heavier hydrocarbons 40%. Fuels for which we have no traceable reference will remain at 35%. Also, RADIATIVE_FRACTION is now set on the REAC line, not the RADI line. Old input files will be stopped with an ERROR to emphasize the change.</p>
<h6 id="implement-multi-fuel-radiant-fraction-model-a.-gupta-et-al.-fm-global-2015">Implement multi-fuel radiant fraction model [<a href="https://sites.google.com/site/fmw2015archive/2015-presentations">A. Gupta et al. FM Global 2015</a>]</h6>
<p>If multiple fuels are present, e.g., one fuel for cardboard and one fuel for polystyrene combustion, then the radiant fraction will be computed locally as reaction-weighted value. For example, if the two fuels are 20% and 40% radiative fraction with, respectively, 80% and 20% of the heat in a grid cell, CHI_R would be 0.8 x 0.2 + 0.2 x 0.4 = 0.24. Thus, CHI_R will vary in space and time.</p>
<h6 id="modify-mu-and-k-calculation-for-gas-mixtures">Modify mu and k calculation for gas mixtures</h6>
<p>Determining mu (dynamic viscosity) and k (thermal conductivity) for gas mixtures with high accuracy involves a fairly complex averaging process over all pairs of species in the mixture. Prior to FDS 6.3, this cost was avoided by using a simple mole fraction weighting. This method works well if the mixture components have similar molecular weights. For well-ventilated fires of ordinary combustibles, where the mixture in the computational domain is dominated by N2, O2, CO2, and H2O, this limitation is appropriate. In other uses, such as using FDS to examine hydrogen dispersion, this simple approach does not work as well. In FDS 6.3, a new weighting approach has been implemented using a method developed by the US Bureau of Mines. This approach weights by mole fraction and the square root of the molecular weight. Errors for compositions with large molecular weight differences have been reported as under 10 %.</p>
<h6 id="change-to-nasa-polynomial-fits-for-specific-heats">Change to NASA polynomial fits for specific heats</h6>
<p>Polynomial fits for specific heats were changed from JANAF data to NASA polynomials where NASA data is available. The main motivation for this change was to make it easier to do direct comparisons between FDS and Cantera, Chemkin, or other kinetics software where NASA polynomials are typically used. For most users this change will go unnoticed as the differences between the two sets of polynomial fits are small.</p>

<p>To address potential realizability violations in species mass fractions (realizability requires Y_i &gt;=0 and sum_i Y_i = 1, for all i), we now solve transport equations for all Ns species and obtain the mass density, rho, from sum_i rhoY_i. This guarantees realizability provided rhoY_i &gt;=0 (i.e., we enforce boundedness).

<h4 id="fds-5.2">FDS 5.2</h4>
<ul>
<li><p>A simple &quot;Eddy Dissipation&quot; model is added to predict the mixing time of fuel and oxygen. Previous versions of FDS used the time step, which was tied to the flow velocity via the CFL criterion. The eddy dissipation model ties the mixing time to the turbulent diffusion coefficient, which is ultimately related to the eddy viscosity of the Smagorinsky form of LES. The eddy dissipation concept is based on scaling arguments and involves an empirical coefficient which has been determined by comparing calculations to classical fire plume experiments and correlations.</p></li>
<li><p>The names of the output quantities have changed, but the old names are still acceptable.
