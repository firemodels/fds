%
% This script creates the plots that are included in the FDS Validation 
% Guide. It consists of calls to other scripts contained within the
% subfolder called "scripts". 
%
% The most important script is called dataplot. It reads the file called
% validation_data_config_matlab.csv and generates 1000+ plots. If you
% want to process only some of these plots, comment out the other 
% scripts and change the data plot line as follows:
%
% [saved_data,drange] = dataplot(cfil,vdir,plotdir,[a:b]);
%
% where a and b are the lines in the .csv file you want to process.
% Alternatively, you can specify the "Dataname" you want:
%
% [saved_data,drange] = dataplot(cfil,vdir,plotdir,'WTC');
%
% In this case, all the WTC results will be plotted.

% dataplot creates most of the plots for the Validation Guide. It must be run before scatplot, which makes the scatter plots.
