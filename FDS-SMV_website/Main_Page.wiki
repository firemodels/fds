*Fire Dynamics Simulator (FDS)* is a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model of fire-driven fluid flow. The software solves numerically a form of the Navier-Stokes equations appropriate for low-speed, thermally-driven flow, with an emphasis on smoke and heat transport from fires.

*Smokeview (SMV)* is a visualization program that is used to display the output of FDS and CFAST simulations.

*FDS+Evac* is the evacuation simulation module for FDS. The software is used to simulate the movement of people in evacuation situations. The evacuation simulations can be fully coupled with the fire simulations.
