\chapter{Preface}

This is Volume 3 of the FDS Technical Reference Guide. Volume 1 describes the mathematical model and numerical method. Volume 2 documents past and
present model verification work. Instructions for using FDS are contained in a separate User's Guide~\cite{FDS_Users_Guide}.

The FDS Technical Reference Guide is based in part on the ``Standard Guide for Evaluating the Predictive Capability of
Deterministic Fire Models,'' ASTM~E~1355~\cite{ASTM:E1355}. ASTM~E~1355 defines {\em model evaluation} as ``the process of quantifying the accuracy
of chosen results from a model when applied for a specific use.'' The model evaluation process consists of two main components: verification and
validation. {\em Verification} is a process to check the correctness of the solution of the governing equations. Verification does not imply that the
governing equations are appropriate; only that the equations are being solved correctly. {\em Validation} is a process to determine the
appropriateness of the governing equations as a mathematical model of the physical phenomena of interest. Typically, validation involves comparing
model results with experimental measurement. Differences that cannot be explained in terms of numerical errors in the model or uncertainty in the
measurements are attributed to the assumptions and simplifications of the physical model.

Evaluation is critical to establishing both the acceptable uses and limitations of a model. Throughout its development, FDS has undergone various
forms of evaluation, both at NIST and beyond. This volume provides a survey of validation work conducted to date to evaluate FDS.

\section{Summary of FDS Model Uncertainty Statistics}

Table~\ref{summary_stats} lists the summary statistics for the different quantities examined in this Guide. This is, for each quantity of interest, Table~\ref{summary_stats} lists the bias and relative standard deviation of the predicted values. It also lists the total number of experimental data sets on which these statistics are based, as well as the total number of point to point comparisons. Obviously, the more data sets and the more points, the more reliable the statistics.

For further details about model uncertainty and the meaning of these statistics, see Chapter~\ref{Error_Chapter}.

\section{Normality Tests}
\label{normality_tests}

The histograms on the following pages display the distribution of the quantity $\ln(M/E)$, where $M$ is a random variable representing the \underline{M}odel prediction and $E$ is a random variable representing the \underline{E}xperimental measurement. Recall from Chapter~\ref{Error_Chapter} that $\ln(M/E)$ is assumed to be normally distributed. To test this assumption for each of the quantities of interest listed in Table~\ref{summary_stats}, Spiegelhalter's normality test has been applied~\cite{Spiegelhalter:Biometrika1983}. This test examines a set of values, $x_1,...,x_n$ whose mean and standard deviation are computed as follows:
\be
   \bar{x} = \sum_{i=1}^n x_i  \quad ; \quad \sigma^2 = \frac{1}{n-1}  \sum_{i=1}^n \left( x_i - \bar{x} \right)^2
\ee
Spiegelhalter tests the null hypothesis that the sample $x_i$ is taken from a normally distributed population. The test statistic, $S$, is defined:
\be
   S = \frac{N-0.73 \, n}{0.9 \, \sqrt{n}}  \quad ; \quad N=\sum_{i=1}^n Z_i^2 \, \ln \, Z_i^2  \quad ; \quad Z_i = \frac{x_i - \bar{x}}{\sigma}
\ee
Under the null hypothesis, the test statistic is normally distributed with mean 0 and standard deviation of 1. If the $p$-value
\be
   p = 1 - \left| \erf \left( \frac{S}{\sqrt{2}} \right) \right|
\ee
is less than 0.05, the null hypothesis is rejected.

The flaw in most normality tests is that they tend to reject the assumption of normality when the number of samples is relatively large. As can be seen in some of the histograms on the following pages, some fairly ``normal'' looking distributions fail while decidedly non-normal distributions pass. For this reason, the $p$-value is less important than the qualitative appearance of the histogram. If the histogram exhibits the typical bell-shaped curve, this adds confidence to the statistical treatment of the data. If the histogram is not bell-shaped, this might cast doubt on the statistical treatment for that particular quantity.
