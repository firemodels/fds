<p>Latest FDS and Smokeview available at 
<a href="http://fire.nist.gov/fds">http://fire.nist.gov/fds</a>
<ul>
<li>5.2 (build xxxx) - July 6, 2008
<ol>
<li>fix - fix bug that occurs when drawing smoke on a computer without a GPU enabled video card.
<li>fix - force terrain normals to be smooth across mesh boundaries so that seams 
are not visible
<li>fix - fix time advance when adjusting 3D slice/vector files.
<li>enhancement - add option to speed up smoke drawing using the GPU 
(note: not supported on Linux or Mac OSX releases).  The option is turned off
by default and may be toggled on and off by pressing the 'G' key.
<li>enhancement - add a scripting option to allow one to load data, set views and render 
one or more images using commands in the script. 
Scripts are created by turning on the <em>script recorder</em> found in the 
Load/Unload>Script Options menu.
<li>enhancment - internal change in smokeview resulting in reduced memory 
requirements when loading large cases.
<li>enhancement - allow slice and vector slice files to conform to the terrain.

</ol>
<li>5.1.6 (build 1736) - May 31, 2008
<ol>
<li>enhancement - allow slice and vector slice files to conform to terrain (for WUI applications)
<li>fix - print out the keyword &TAIL at the end of the file when editing blockages
(<a href="http://code.google.com/p/fds-smv/issues/detail?id=366&can=1&sort=-id">Issue 366</a>).
<li>fix - fix display of PLOT3D contours
(<a href="http://code.google.com/p/fds-smv/issues/detail?id=361&can=1&sort=-id">Issue 361</a>).
<li>fix - fix lighting bug when displaying terrain
</ol>
<li>5.1.5 (build 1666) - May 10, 2008
<ol>
<li>fix - fix display of hrrpuv cutoff value
(<a href="http://code.google.com/p/fds-smv/issues/detail?id=355&can=1&sort=-id">Issue 355</a>).
</ol>
<li>5.1.4 (build 1635) - May 5, 2008
<ol>
<li>enhancement - save smooth blockages to a file so that their definition may be read in rather than re-calculated.  
<li>enhancement - add an option to simplify file compression by compressing only files that were selected for auto-loading.
<li>enhancement - save the size preserving or perspective projection state in the .ini file
(<a href="http://code.google.com/p/fds-smv/issues/detail?id=331&can=1&sort=-id">Issue 331</a>).
<li>enhancement - implement the "AUTOTERRAIN" keyword for WUI applications of FDS.  If all blockages are used to implement terrain
(ie no blockages are used to represent buildings on the terrain), then AUTOTERRAIN is used to signal Smokeview to draw a smooth 
surface representing the terrain.
<li>enhancement -  add option to toggle slice file offset - 
(<a href="http://code.google.com/p/fds-smv/issues/detail?id=348&can=1&sort=-id">Issue 348</a>).
<li>enhancement - add support for skipping particle frames created by FDS 5 or later.
(<a href="http://code.google.com/p/fds-smv/issues/detail?id=350&can=1&sort=-id">Issue 350</a>).
<li>fix - For particle files created by FDS 5, remove the particle skip option as it is no longer supported. (<a href="http://code.google.com/p/fds-smv/issues/detail?id=350&can=1&sort=-id">Issue 350</a>).
<li>fix - change a conversion factor from 256*128 to 256*128-1 to avoid a "short int" overflow.   Otherwise, some
particles may be drawn outside the solution domain.
(<a href="http://code.google.com/p/fds-smv/issues/detail?id=323&can=1&sort=-id">Issue 323</a>).
<li>fix - fix the 't' toggle when the grid is turned on.
(<a href="http://code.google.com/p/fds-smv/issues/detail?id=334&can=1&sort=-id">Issue 334</a>).
<li>fix - force smooth blockages to be drawn opaquely to prevent drawing artifact errors when drawn with smoke.
(<a href="http://code.google.com/p/fds-smv/issues/detail?id=329&can=1&sort=-id">Issue 329</a>).
<li>fix - Fix drawing when smoke, iso and slice routines have non-increasing time steps.
This could occur when FDS is restarted to an earlier time than was saved in these data files.
(<a href="http://code.google.com/p/fds-smv/issues/detail?id=317&can=1&sort=-id">Issue 317</a>).
<li>fix - fix drawing of text on the colorbar 
(<a href="http://code.google.com/p/fds-smv/issues/detail?id=325&can=1&sort=-id">Issue 325</a>).
</ol>
<li>5.1.3 (build 1501) - March 26, 2008
<ol>
<li>enhancement -  redo grid show menu to make clearer which grid planes will be visible once grid drawing is turned on.  
(<a href="http://code.google.com/p/fds-smv/issues/detail?id=308&can=1&sort=-id">Issue 308</a>)
<li>fix - fix data chopping (<a href="http://code.google.com/p/fds-smv/issues/detail?id=303&can=1&sort=-id">Issue 303</a>).
</ol>

<ol>
<li>enhancement - add option to select frame skip for isosurface and slice files (in addition to boundary and 3D 
smoke files) when compressing data with smokezip.
<li>enhancement - add demo mode, activated by copying casename.smv to casename.svd .  
This mode is used to demonstrate an FDS/Smokeview case by presenting a simplified dialog box with pre-defined tours
<li>enhancement - add the command line option -skip val to the companion program <bold>smokezip</bold> to allow
frame skipping specifiation when running this tool from a command shell.
</ol>
<li>5.1 (build 1345) - February 20, 2008
<ol>
<li>enhancement - add demo mode, activated by copying casename.smv to casename.svd .

and viewpoints (defined in an .ini file).  Further details are found in the Smokeview user's guide.
<li>enhancement - add avatars to FDS-EVAC visualizations and Smokeview tours.  Avatars are defined in the device.svo file.
<li>enhancement - add option to clip ONLY scene geometry allowing FDS data to remain visible.
