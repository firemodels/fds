<h2>Smokeview Experimental - Release Notes</h2>
<p>November 11, 2007<br>
Revision: 971<br>

<p>This readme file describes several new features 
in an experimental version of Smokeview available for testing at the 
<a href="http://code.google.com/p/fds-smv/downloads/list"<a>download site</a>.  
This version of Smokeview is designed to be backwards 
compatible with the <em>official</em> version also located at the 
<a href="http://code.google.com/p/fds-smv/downloads/list"<a>download site</a>.  
However, there are no guarantees.  Use this version with caution.

<p>The following options will be tested and refined over the next year and as they become sufficiently polished they 
will be incorporated into the official Smokeview release.

<p><ul>
<li><a href="#GPU">GPU</a> - The video card is used to speed up 3D smoke visualization
<li><a href="#culling">Culling</a> - 3D smoke drawing is further speeded up by detecting blockage hidden smoke planes.
<li><a href="#colorbar">Custom Color bars</a> - Custom colorbars may be created to highlight specific data.
<li><a href="#memory">Memory management</a> - Smokeview's memory management routines are modified to reduce the risk and consequences 
of memory leaks.
<li><a href="#lighting">Lighting</a> - More control is added for illuminating the scene.
</ul>

<a name="GPU"></a>
<h3>GPU </h3>
<p>The GPU or graphics programming unit is used to speed up 
the display of smoke.  This feature is turned on and off by pressing the <strong>G</strong> key.
Some of the smoke flow computations required to visualize smoke are now
performed on the GPU rather than the CPU.  Speed ups of up to 50% have been observed.

<ul>

<li>Copy glew32.dll from the .zip archive to the directory containing Smokeview (default: c:\program files\nist\smokeview).

<li>This option is activated (or deactivated) by pressing the <strong>G</strong> key.  

<li>Smokeview tries to determine whether a programmable GPU is available for
performing these computations.  Since the computers that I have access to are GPU capable,
this version of Smokeview has
not been tested on computers that are not.

<li>The fastest speed ups occur when the simulation has many 3D smoke planes.
Note that 3D smoke display may be speeded using the official version of Smokeview (at a loss of resolution)
by using the 
3D Smokeview dialog box to skip
smoke planes.
<li>Smoke thickenss may now be adjusted continuously rather than in discrete steps.
This adjustment is made practical by performing the computation on the GPU.

</ul>

<a name="culling"></a>
<h3>Culling</h3>
The best way to speed up any computation is not to do it in the first place!
This applies to visualization as well.  The best way to speed up drawing in a graphics program is simply not to do it.
The hard part is figuring out when you can get away with this.
This process of not drawing graphical elements is called <em>culling</em>.  There are several types of culling used by Smokeview.  
View frustum culling eliminates 
objects that would not appear on the screen if drawn.  Smokeview (the official version) already
uses view frustum to speed up 3D smoke visualization.
<p>View frustum culling is not effective for culling objects that are hidden by other objects but 
would otherwise appear on the screen.  
OpenGL 1.5 and later has a feature to determine whether an object would be visible
in the presence of other drawn objects.  The experimental version of Smokeview uses this feature to determine
whether 3D smoke is hidden by blockages.
<p>Notes:
<ul>

<li>This option is used in conjunction with the GPU programming option so is also activated/deactivated
by pressing the <strong>G</strong> key.
<li>This option has not been tested on systems where it is not available.  Smokeview has been designed
so that if the option is not available it reverts back to the former method for drawing smoke.
<li>Speed ups depend on the amount of geometry (&OBST's) present in the scene.  You can expect
that smoke flow in a house will speed up more than smoke flow in an open fire plume.
<li>This extenstion has only been implemented for the 3 view directions alligned with the coordinate axese.
View directions where smoke planes are diagonal the these axes do not have this culling extension
implemented.
</ul>

<h3>Custom Color Bars</h3>
A new dialog box has been implemented for creating custom color bars.  
In some sense a color bar is equivalent to a <em>Smokeview tour</em>.  Both are 3D paths.  A tour is a path through
3D physical space.  A colorbar is a path through 3D <em>RGB color</em> space.   
Colorbars that are discontinuous may be used to highlight or make certain color ranges more conspicuous.

<a name="memory"></a>
<h3>Memory management</h3>
This is an internal technical change in how Smokeview allocates and deallocates
needed memory.  If implemented improperly, it could have have undesirable
side effects (Smokeview would most likely crash).  The major enhancment was to create a dynamic list of 
currently allocated memory blocks so that memory blocks may be easily deallocated with one procedure call 
thus eliminating the possibility 
of a memory leak.

<a name="lighting"></a>
<h3>Lighting</h3>
A minor addition to add a menu option to allow one to select lights used to illuminate 
the scene.  This choice is made for you in the <em>official</em> version of Smokeview.
