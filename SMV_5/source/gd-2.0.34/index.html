<blockquote>
<strong>UPGRADING UNIX USERS: READ THIS FIRST!</strong>
Modern versions of gd install by default to /usr/local/lib and
/usr/local/include. If you already have an older version of gd
in /usr/lib and /usr/include, you may wish to use:
<pre>
./configure --prefix=/usr</pre> 
To ensure that your
new installation overwrites the old.
<p>
<strong>GIF support has been restored in gd 2.0.28 and above.</strong>
The well-known patents on LZW compression held by Unisys
have expired in all countries. British Telecom and IBM may hold related
patents but have never chosen to require royalties for GIF applications,
to the best of my knowledge. I am not a lawyer and cannot give
legal advice regarding this issue. PNG remains a superior format especially
if lossless truecolor images are needed.
<p>
When building from soruce, gd 2.0.33 <strong>requires</strong> that the 
following libraries also be installed, in order to produce the related 
image formats. The win32 binary release (bgd) already contains the
appropriate libraries.
You may skip libraries associated with formats you do not use:
<p>
libpng (see the <a href="http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/">libpng home page</a>), if you want PNG
<p>
zlib (see the <a href="http://www.info-zip.org/pub/infozip/zlib/">info-zip home page</a>), if you want PNG
<p>
jpeg-6b or later, if desired (see the <a href="http://www.ijg.org/">Independent JPEG Group home page</a>), if you want JPEG
<p>
If you want to use the TrueType font support, you must also
install the <strong>FreeType 2.x library</strong>, including
the header files. See the <a href="http://www.freetype.org/">Freetype 
Home Page</a>, or <a href="http://freetype.sourceforge.net/">SourceForge</a>. 
No, I cannot explain why that site is down on a particular day, and no, I 
can't send you a copy.
<p>
If you want to use the Xpm color bitmap loading support, you must also
have the X Window System and the Xpm library installed (Xpm is often
included in modern X distributions). Most of the time you won't
need Xpm.
<p>
Please read the documentation and install the required libraries.
Do not send email asking why <code>png.h</code> is not found. 
Do not send email asking why <code>libgd.so</code> is not found, either.
See the <a href="#required">requirements section</a> for more
information. Thank you!

<A NAME="whatis"><H3>What is gd?</H3></A>
<P>
gd is a graphics library. It allows your code to quickly
draw images complete with lines, arcs, text, multiple
colors, cut and paste from other images, and flood fills, and
write out the result as a PNG or JPEG file. This is particularly
useful in World Wide Web applications, where PNG and JPEG are two
of the formats accepted for inline images by most browsers.
<P>
gd is not a paint program.
If you are looking for a paint program, you are looking in
the wrong place. If you are not a programmer, you are looking
in the wrong place, unless you are installing a required
library in order to run an application.
<P>
gd does not provide for every possible desirable graphics
operation. It is not necessary or desirable for gd to become
a kitchen-sink graphics package, but version 2.0 does include
most frequently requested features, including both truecolor and
palette images, resampling (smooth resizing of truecolor images)
and so forth.
<P>
<A NAME="gdother"><H3>What if I want to use another programming
language?</h3></A>
Not all of these tools are necessarily up to date and fully compatible
with 2.0.33.
<h4>PHP</h4>
A variant of gd 2.x is included in PHP 4.3.0. It is also possible
to patch PHP 4.2.3 for use with gd 2.0.33; see the
<a href="http://www.libgd.org/">gd home page</a> for a link to
that information. It would be a Good Idea to merge all of the things
that are better in mainstream gd and all of the things that are
better in PHP gd at some point in the near future. 
<h4>Perl</h4>
gd can also be used from Perl, courtesy of
Lincoln Stein's
<a href="http://stein.cshl.org/WWW/software/GD/">
GD.pm</a> library, which uses gd as the basis for a set of
Perl 5.x classes. Highly recommended.
<h4>OCaml</h4>
gd can be used from OCaml, thanks to
<a href="http://gd4o.sourceforge.net/">Matt Gushee's GD4O project</a>.
<h4>Tcl</h4>
gd can be used from Tcl with John Ellson's
<a href=http://www.graphviz.org/pub/>Gdtclft</a>
dynamically loaded extension package.
<h4>Pascal</h4>
Pascal enthusiasts should look into the
<a href="http://www.freepascal.org/">freepascal</a> project, a
free Pascal compiler that includes gd support.
<h4>REXX</h4>
A 
<a href="http://www.lightlink.com/hessling/RexxGd/index.html">gd interface 
for the REXX language</a> is available.
<h4>Any Language</h4>
The "fly" interpreter performs gd operations specified in a text file.
You can output the desired commands to a simple
text file from whatever scripting language you prefer to use, then
invoke the interpreter.

<A NAME="whatsnew2.0.34"><h3>What's new in version 2.0.34?</h3></a>
<p>
From 2.0.34 and later, please check the ISSUES and ChangeLog as well as 
the releases announcements.
<p>
<A NAME="whatsnew2.0.33"><h3>What's new in version 2.0.33?</h3></a>
<p>
Version 2.0.33 restores compatibility with older releases
of Freetype 2.x in addition to the latest release. Thanks to
John Ellson and the graphviz project.
<p>
<A NAME="whatsnew2.0.32"><h3>What's new in version 2.0.32?</h3></a>
<p>
Version 2.0.32 restores correct detection of Unicode character sets
for freetype fonts, which repairs a bug that prevented umlauts from
displaying properly. Thanks to John Ellson and the graphviz project.
Also, version 2.0.32 builds all test programs 
smoothly in the absence of libpng. 
<p>
<A NAME="whatsnew2.0.31"><h3>What's new in version 2.0.31?</h3></a>
<p>
A minor type naming conflict prevented bgd.dll from compiling, and it
was left out of the distribution as a result. This has been corrected.
<p>
<A NAME="whatsnew2.0.30"><h3>What's new in version 2.0.30?</h3></a>
<p>
2.0.29 did not compile correctly when freetype was not available.
This has been corrected. Thanks to Alessandro Ranellucci.
<p>
<A NAME="whatsnew2.0.29"><h3>What's new in version 2.0.29?</h3></a>
<p>
<ul>
<li>A 32-bit multiplication overflow vulnerability reported on
the Bugtraq mailing list has been corrected, along with a number
of similar issues. These bugs come into play only when attempting
to deal with images with <i>extremely large</i> dimensions.
The relevant functions now fail gracefully when such extreme
parameters are specified. The code in question is also 
correct for systems with larger bit depths. Thanks to Phil Knirsch,
Alan Cox and infamous41md.
Since exploits are theoretically possible, upgrading is recommended.
<li>Support for the fontconfig library, when available. 
When fontconfig is available and gdFTUseFontConfig(1) has been invoked
or the gdFTEX_FONTCONFIG flag has been set for a particular call, fontconfig
patterns can be used to fetch the best available font. 
For instance, "arial:bold:italic" does the right thing (or as close as
the available fonts permit). Also, standard 
PostScript font names can be mapped to an appropriate font by 
gdImageStringFTEx and relatives. 
When fontconfig is available <tt>gdlib-config --features</tt> will list
the GD_FONTCONFIG feature. For more information about fontconfig, see the
<a href="http://freedesktop.org/software/fontconfig">fontconfig pages</a>.
<p>
The actual resolved font filename can be returned in the gdFTStringExtra
structure as the fontpath element if the gdFTEX_RETURNFONTPATHNAME flag
is set. Also, a 
vector of character position advances can be retrieved if gdFTEX_XSHOW is set 
in the flags element. .afm files (font metrics) are now used to adjust size 
calculations
when available. When fontconfig is not available, gd falls back to its
usual behavior and requires a specific font file name. One can
still fetch fonts by filename when gdFTUseFontConfig(1) is in effect, by
setting the gdFTEX_FONTPATHNAME flag
in the flag element of the gdFTStringExtra structure. Thanks to
Dag Lem and John Ellson.
<li>Additional freetype fixes: fixed width fonts are now the right
size, horizontal advance calculations now better match the
PostScript equivalent, and various compiler warning fixes. Also,
a fix to the encoding table selection in the was made, addressing a problem
with latin1 font encodings. Thanks to Dag Lem and John Ellson. 
<li>Improved tolerance when reading JPEG files containing some garbage as well
as valid image data.
<li>Easier compilation on Windows: no errno.h in gd_gd2.c.
<li>Support for creating optimized GIF animations has been added
 by Jaakko Hyv&auml;tti.  See
 <A HREF="#gdImageGifAnimAdd">gdImageGifAnimAdd</A>,
 <A HREF="#gdImageGifAnimAddCtx">gdImageGifAnimAddCtx</A>,

 <A HREF="#gdImageGifAnimEndCtx">gdImageGifAnimEndCtx</A>, and
 <A HREF="#gdImageGifAnimEndPtr">gdImageGifAnimEndPtr</A>.
<li><A HREF="#gdImageOpenPolygon">gdImageOpenPolygon</A> has been
 added to allow consecutive line segments to be drawn without
 connecting the end points to form a closed polygon. Thanks to
Jaakko Hyv&auml;tti.
<li>Better alpha channel blending when the destination color
contains an alpha channel. Also, quicker handling of the
most common cases. Thanks to Frank Warmerdam.
</ul>
<P>
<A NAME="whatsnew2.0.28"><H3>What's new in version 2.0.28?</H3></A>
<P>
<ul>
<li>GIF support has been restored. See
<a href="#gdImageGif">gdImageGif</a>, 
<a href="#gdImageGifCtx">gdImageGifCtx</a>, 
<a href="#gdImageGifPtr">gdImageGifPtr</a>, 
<a href="#gdImageCreateFromGif">gdImageCreateFromGif</a>, 
<a href="#gdImageCreateFromGifCtx">gdImageCreateFromGifCtx</a>, 
and <a href="#gdImageCreateFromGifPtr">gdImageCreateFromGifPtr</a>.
These functions are now thread-safe, similar to the PNG and JPEG
manipulation functions.
<li>The new <a href="#gdImageCreatePaletteFromTrueColor">gdImageCreatePaletteFromTrueColor</a> function is identical to <a href="#gdImageTrueColorToPalette">gdImageTrueColorToPalette</a>, except that it returns a new image rather than permanently modifying the original.
</ul>
<P>
<A NAME="whatsnew2.0.27"><H3>What's new in version 2.0.27?</H3></A>
<P>
<ul>
<li>In gd 2.0.26, there was potential for out of bounds fills, and therefore
crashes, in the horizontalLine function used by gdImageFilledPolygon.
Fixed by John Ellson.
<li>The order of the points returned in the bounding rectangle by
gdImageStringFT was incorrect in version 2.0.26. This has been
corrected in version 2.0.27. Thanks to Riccardo Cohen for pointing
this out, and to John Ellson for verifying and fixing it.
</ul>
<P>
<A NAME="whatsnew2.0.26"><H3>What's new in version 2.0.26?</H3></A>
<P>
The following enhancements and fixes:
<ul>
<li>Drastically faster, less memory-intensive antialiased drawing, thanks to
Pierre-Alain Joye. This code was imported from the PHP "fork"
of gd. The API for antialiased drawing has not changed, however the
implementation has been completely replaced.
Antialiased line drawing does not support widths other
than 1, however this did not work properly with the other
implementation of antialiasing either. Support has been included
for the "non-blending color" option introduced by the previous
implementation of antialiased drawing.
<li><code>gdlib-config</code>, which has been installed by 
<code>make install</code> for some time now, has gained
a <code>--features</code> option. This option produces a space-separated
list of optional features with which the gd library was compiled.
Typical usage looks like this:
<pre>
% gdlib-config --features
GD_XPM GD_JPEG GD_FREETYPE GD_PNG GD_GIF
</pre>
Other <code>configure</code> scripts can conveniently define
preprocessor symbols based on this list in order to conditionally
compile code. For instance, if
GD_PNG is not reported by --features, then gdImagePng is not
included in the library.
<p>
Thanks to Lars Hecking and Lincoln Stein for their advice on
implementing this feature. Any blame for the actual implementation
is entirely due to me (TBB).
<li>Fixes to the behavior of the bounding rectangle returned by
gdImageStringFT and relatives when the string is rotated.
See fontwheeltest.c. Thanks to John Ellson.
<li>Previously, gdImageStringFT and friends accepted either 
a full path to a font file, or the name of a font with no
extension, in which case the GDFONTPATH environment variable
and then the compiled-in DEFAULT_FONTPATH was searched. In addition,
a font filename with an extension but no full path can now be
automatically searched for in the same fashion. Thanks to John Ellson.

<li>Fixes to freetype antialiased text against a transparent 
background. See testtr.c. Thanks to John Ellson.

<li>Support for named entities like &amp;amp; and hex-coded 
entities such as &amp;#x6C34; in text 
strings passed to gdImageStringFT and relatives, adding to the 
previous support for decimal-coded entities like &amp;#197;. 
These were extracted from entities.html (from the W3C) via
the script entities.tcl, which is included for the curious and
those with other entities they need support for.  Thanks to John Ellson.

<li>Optimization: gdImageSetPixel no longer calls gdImageAlphaBlend 
when either the source or the destination pixel is 100% transparent. 
Thanks to John Ellson.

<li>Optimization: gdImageLine is potentially faster now in the most 
common cases.
Thanks to John Ellson.
<li>Documentation of the entities feature of gdImageStringFT.
<li>autoconf/configure fixes. Thanks to many who pointed out an oversight
in handling libpng flags.
</ul>
<P>
<A NAME="whatsnew2.0.25"><H3>What's new in version 2.0.25?</H3></A>
<P>
Owing to an oversight while making changes to better accommodate the use
of gd as a DLL, the <b>extern</b> qualifier was dropped from the 
declarations of font pointers in 2.0.24. This has been corrected.
Thanks to Richard ("OpenMacNews").
<P>
<A NAME="whatsnew2.0.24"><H3>What's new in version 2.0.24?</H3></A>
<P>
<b>Windows DLL now uses __stdcall calling convention.</b> Existing
applications will require a recompile, using the new version of gd.h,
in order to use this version of the DLL. However, Visual BASIC and other
non-C programmers will now be able to use the DLL, which is an enormous
benefit and justifies the one-time inconvenience to existing DLL users. 
<p>
The elaborate #ifdef test for older versions of Freetype without
FT_ENCODING_MS_SYMBOL was needed in a second place also. Thanks to
David R. Morrison.
<p>
An off-by-one error in gdImageToPalette caused transparency to be applied
to the wrong pixels. Thanks to "Super Pikeman."
<P>
<A NAME="whatsnew2.0.23"><H3>What's new in version 2.0.23?</H3></A>
<P>
Output dpi specification option added to the
<code>gdFTStringExtra</code> structure, thanks to
Mark Shackelford. See <a href="#gdImageStringFTEx">gdImageStringFTEx</a>.
<P>
<A NAME="whatsnew2.0.22"><H3>What's new in version 2.0.22?</H3></A>
<P>
<ul>
<li>Win32 DLL users: working with pointers exported by DLLs is 
difficult and causes unexpected results. gd 2.0.22 exports new
functions for retrieving the basic gd fonts:
<a href="#gdFontGetTiny">gdFontGetTiny()</a>,
<a href="#gdFontGetSmall">gdFontGetSmall()</a>,
<a href="#gdFontGetMediumBold">gdFontGetMediumBold()</a>,
<a href="#gdFontGetLarge">gdFontGetLarge()</a>, and
<a href="#gdFontGetHuge">gdFontGetHuge()</a>. You may safely assign the
return values from these functions to a local <code>gdFontPtr</code>.
Direct use of <code>gdFontLarge</code>, etc. is strongly deprecated
for users of <code>bgd.dll</code>; use these new functions instead.
<li>Basic support for loading CMYK-colorspace JPEG images. They are
of course converted to RGB which is a lossy process, however the
results do look quite good and are certainly fine for thumbnails and
web previews of DTP work.
<li>"make" no longer fails on <code>circletexttest</code> if 
PNG support is missing. 
<li>Small performance improvements to gdImageCopyResampled; larger
improvements are forthcoming.
</ul>
<P>
<A NAME="whatsnew2.0.21"><H3>What's new in version 2.0.21?</H3></A>
<P>
<ul>
<li>Version 2.0.21 adds a <code>gdImageCreateFrom*Ptr</code> family
of functions which make it convenient to load an image in any
GD-supported format directly from memory.
<li>The new <code>gdNewDynamicCtxEx</code> function was added to
support the easy implementation of the above functions and to
correct a design problem which made life unpleasant for those passing
in memory not originally allocated by gd to the 
<code>gdNewDynamicCtx</code> function by provoding a way to specify
that gd should never free or reallocate a particular block of memory.
The <code>gdNewDynamicCtx</code> function and its relatives, although
still exported for ABI compatibility, are now <b>deprecated</b> except 
for internal use, in favor of <a href="#gdImageCreateFromPngPtr"><code>gdImageCreateFromPngPtr</code></a>
and its relatives.
<li>Version 2.0.21 includes a new patch from Ethan A. Merritt to
correct a bug in the conditional compilation of support for
symbol fonts in gdft.c. Symbol fonts should now work correctly.
Thanks to Mr. Merritt.
<li>Version 2.0.20 restores the <code>gdFreeFontCache</code> function,
an undocumented function added in an earlier release which now simply
calls <code>gdFontCacheShutdown</code> for backwards compatibility.
This repairs build problems when compiling PHP against the latest gd.
<li>Documentation improvements.
</ul>
<P>
<A NAME="whatsnew2.0.20"><H3>What's new in version 2.0.20?</H3></A>
<P>
<ul>
<li>Version 2.0.20 restores the <code>gdFreeFontCache</code> function,
an undocumented function added in an earlier release which now simply
calls <code>gdFontCacheShutdown</code> for backwards compatibility.
This repairs build problems when compiling PHP against the latest gd.
</ul>
<P>
<A NAME="whatsnew2.0.19"><H3>What's new in version 2.0.19?</H3></A>
<P>
<ul>
<li>Version 2.0.19 restored <code>extern</code> declarations for the
gd font pointers inadvertently removed in 2.0.18.
</ul>
<P>
<A NAME="whatsnew2.0.18"><H3>What's new in version 2.0.18?</H3></A>
<P>
<ul>
<li>A Win32 binary distribution of "bgd.dll," built with mingw32 and
tested with win32 versions of the demo programs as console applications,
is now available.
<li>Semicolon rather than space used as the default separator of
alternative font file paths in <a href="#gdImageStringFT">gdImageStringFT</a>,
for better compatibility with Windows and other environments where
spaces are common in paths.
<li>The circletexttest demo no longer fails to compile when JPEG
support happens to be absent.
</ul>
<P>
<A NAME="whatsnew2.0.17"><H3>What's new in version 2.0.17?</H3></A>
<P>
Minor compilation and packaging problems with 2.0.16 were corrected.
If 2.0.16 compiled without errors for you, then you don't need
to upgrade to 2.0.17.
<P>
<A NAME="whatsnew2.0.16"><H3>What's new in version 2.0.16?</H3></A>
<P>
<ul>
<li>Thread safety for freetype text output. Background: all gd functions
were already thread safe, as long as only one thread manipulates each
image -- except for gdImageStringFT and gdImageStringFTEx. This is because
of a shared freetype font cache. Sharing the cache between images
is worthwhile, so "configure" now detects pthreads and uses it to
wrap freetype text output in a critical section if available. There is
also critical section support under WIN32. Those who wish to be
strictly thread-safe should call the new function
<a href="#gdFontCacheSetup">gdFontCacheSetup</a> before allowing any
thread to use freetype text calls. Otherwise this function is automatically
invoked on the first use of freetype, with a very small but real chance
of a race condition.
<li><a href="#gdImageSquareToCircle">gdImageSquareToCircle</a> performs
a "polar coordinate transform," returning a new image in which the
X axis of the original has been remapped to theta (angle) and the
Y axis of the original has been remapped to rho (distance from center).
<li><a href="#gdImageStringFTCircle">gdImageStringFTCircle</a> wraps
text in a circle around a specified center point. This function 
takes advantage of <a href="#gdImageSquareToCircle">gdImageSquareToCircle</a>.
The result is very smooth, although it takes some time to compute.
Thanks to Steve Bassi for sponsoring this work.
<li><a href="#gdImageSharpen">gdImageSharpen</a>, contributed by
Paul Troughton. Thank you.
<li>Christophe Thomas corrected gdft.c to include freetype header
files in the way that is now mandatory in freetype 2.1.6 and above.
<li>Gustavo Scotti fixed a memory leak in gdft.c.
<li>Clipping rectangle respected in freetype text output. Thanks to Matt
McNabb.
<li>Paul den Dulk found a degenerate case that crashes
gdImageToPalette. Fixed.
<li>Optimization by Ilia Chipitsine to avoid wasting time with
offscreen scanlines during polygon rasterization.

little bit. 
<li>Bug in gdImageCopyResized fixed by Mao Morimoto.

<A NAME="whatsnew2.0.15"><H3>What's new in version 2.0.15?</H3></A>
<P>
<ul>
<li>gd.c in 2.0.14 contained an instance of declaring variables
after the first line of executable code appears. This is of course
not allowed by ANSI C, although many compilers accept it. 
My apologies. Thanks to Jeff Vendetti for reporting this quickly.
</ul>
<P>
<A NAME="whatsnew2.0.14"><H3>What's new in version 2.0.14?</H3></A>
<P>
<ul>
<li>2.0.13 was available for mere minutes due to a typo
in the new bounds-checking code for antialiased line drawing. Fixed.
<li>Not all platforms -- notably msys/mingw -- have an ssize_t type.
We now call an int an int in gd_jpeg.c, with good results. 
(Note: ssize_t is signed, unlike size_t, and it needs to be here.)
</ul>
<P>
<A NAME="whatsnew2.0.13"><H3>What's new in version 2.0.13?</H3></A>
<P>
<ul>
<li>The <code>main()</code> function of one of the test programs
was accidentally included in the gd shared library, causing problems
on some platforms. This has been corrected. Thanks to many people
who pointed this out.
<li>The antialiased drawing functions now have proper bounds
checking. Thanks to Arne Jorgensen.
<li>A void function returned a value in gd_png.c, causing warnings
and, on some platforms, compilation errors but no reported runtime problems.
Thanks to Kevin Smith, among others.
<li>Autohinting was being forced ON for freetype text output. This is
apparently meant only for testing freetype and does not look as good
as the default behavior (FT_LOAD_DEFAULT). Thanks to Bob Ostermann.
<li>penf.x is properly reset when newlines are encountered in freetype
text output. Thanks to Christopher J. Grayce.
</ul>
<P>
<A NAME="whatsnew2.0.12"><H3>What's new in version 2.0.12?</H3></A>
<P>
<ul>
<li>Small but numerous code cleanups by Dr. Martin Zinser.
<li><a href="#gdImageSetClip">gdImageSetClip</a> and
<a href="#gdImageGetClip">gdImageGetClip</a> have been added. All
drawing routines now stay within the specified clipping rectangle.
Note that the <a href="#gdImageBoundsSafe">gdImageBoundsSafe</a> function
now returns true only if the specified location is within the
clipping rectangle. Of course, the default clipping area is the 
entire image. The behavior of existing gd applications does not change.
<li>Support for fast drawing of antialiased lines and polygons,
by Bright Fulton and Frank Faubert. To learn more about this feature,
read about the <a href="#gdImageSetAntiAliased">gdImageSetAntiAliased</a> 
function, which is used to set the foreground color for antialiasing,
as well as the <a href="#gdAntiAliased">gdAntiAliased</a> constant, which
is passed to line- and polygon-drawing functions in place of a color.
This code does not currently support an alpha channel component in the
specified foreground color, or in the existing background image, 
but <em>does</em> perform alpha blending against an opaque background.
Also see the 
<a href="#gdImageSetAntiAliasedDontBlend">gdImageSetAntiAliasedDontBlend</a> 
function, which allows the specification of a special background
color that should never be blended with the foreground.
<li>Fixes to color mapping in <a href="#gdImageCopyMergeGray">gdImageCopyMergeGray</a>. Thanks to Philip Warner.
<li><a href="#gdImageStringFTEx">gdImageStringFTEx</a> now supports
explicit specification of the desired character mapping.
This is useful when a font offers more than one of Unicode,
Shift_JIS, and Big5. 
<li>The PNG compression level can now be specified when writing PNG
images. See the new <a href="#gdImagePngEx">gdImagePngEx</a>,
<a href="#gdImagePngEx">gdImagePngEx</a>,
<a href="#gdImagePngCtxEx">gdImagePngCtxEx</a>, and
<a href="#gdImagePngPtrEx">gdImagePngPtrEx</a> functions.
<li>The annotate utility builds without error in the absence of
freetype, although of course it is not useful without freetype.
<li>Thorben Kundinger fixed a bug relating to the use of palette-based
images as brushes when drawing on truecolor images.
<li>Michael Schwartz corrected a problem with his code for drawing
thick lines.
<li>Prior to 2.0.12, any alpha channel component in the
<em>destination</em> image was ignored when drawing with
alpha blending in effect (see 
<a href="#gdImageAlphaBlending">gdImageAlphaBlending</a>). 2.0.12
correctly preserves an appropriate proportion of the alpha component
of the destination, just as it preserves an appropriate proportion
of the red, green and blue components, depending on the opacity
of the foreground. Thanks to Frank Warmerdam for pointing out the issue.
<li>Memory leaks on failed attempts to load fonts
in <a href="#gdImageStringFTEx">gdImageStringFTEx</a> were corrected.
Thanks to Frank Faubert.
<li>The impact of kerning is now correctly included in the calculation
of the bounding box returned by the freetype text routines. This issue
was pointed out by several individuals.
<li>Color problems with the <code>gd2</code> file format routines
were fixed by Steven Brown. These problems were due to the
incorrect use of a signed integer.
<li>Version 2.0.12 supports the <code>gd</code> file format correctly
for truecolor images. Truecolor <code>gd</code> files created with
earlier releases in the 2.0 series must be written again. The <code>gd</code>
file format is used to quickly load an entire uncompressed image, typically 
an existing background to which additional material will be added; it is not a 
general purpose file format. More advanced capabilities are also available
via the <code>gd2</code> format. Thanks to Andreas Pfaller for reporting 
the problem. 
<li>Signed vs. unsigned problem caused misbehavior when attempting to
load a bad JPEG image. Thanks to Geert Jansen.
<li>Existing truecolor PNG images with simple single-color transparency are 
now loaded properly, thanks to Slaven Rezic.
<li>The <a href="#gdImageTrueColorToPalette">gdImageTrueColorToPalette</a>
function no longer attempts to preserve an alpha channel in the original.
My attempt to do so resulted in significantly inferior output even if no
alpha channel was present in the original. Thanks to Barend Gehrels for
submitting a new adaptation of Tom Lane's jquant2.c which does a very
high-quality job of palette conversion. Thanks also to Steven Brown, who
submitted patches allowing a single 100% transparent color in the
original truecolor image to be preserved. In practice, more complex 
alpha channels in palettes are ill-supported and difficult to 
allocate skillfully.
</ul>
<P>
<A NAME="whatsnew2.0.11"><H3>What's new in version 2.0.11?</H3></A>
<P>
<ul>
<li>Support for the "gd2" file format, which allows fast loading of all or
only part of an existing image, has been properly debugged for use with
truecolor images. (Palette images already worked properly, except for a
bug when loading from a regular file with gdImageCreateFromGd2Part, which
has also been fixed.) .gd2 files can be either compressed or uncompressed,
and they allow useful tricks such as fast loading of a 500x500 pixel
region of a 6000x3000 pixel image, without uncompressing <em>all</em> of the
image. .gd2 is NOT a general purpose file format and should only be used
where quick loading of a background image or subset of a larger image
is required. For more information, see
<a href="#gdImageGd2">gdImageGd2</a>, 
<a href="#gdImageCreateFromGd2">gdImageCreateFromGd2</a>,
and 
<a href="#gdImageCreateFromGd2Part">gdImageCreateFromGd2Part</a>.
<li>The gd2topng utility has been extended to support extraction of
only part of an image from a .gd2 file. This is both a demonstration and 
a practical tool.
<li>Additional <code>configure</code> improvements by Lars Hecking.
</ul>
<P>
<A NAME="whatsnew2.0.10"><H3>What's new in version 2.0.10?</H3></A>
<P>
<ul>
<li>gdImageLine now clips to the edges of the image before drawing
lines, which greatly improves performance when many lines extend
outside or are entirely outside the actual image. Thanks to 
Nick Atty for this code.
<li>gdImageBoundsSafe is replaced with a macro when called internally;
this improves the performance of gdImageSetPixel and gdImageGetPixel
a little bit, and therefore everything else as well. Thanks to
Nicky Atty for the idea.
<li>Transparent indexes are handled properly with non-truecolor
source images in gdImageCopy. Thanks to Frank Warmerdam.
<li>floor() replaced with a cast to long in gdImageCopyResampled,
for a roughly 35% performance boost. Thanks to John Buckman.
<li>gdft.c builds correctly on WIN32 without patches.
<li>Much faster gdImageCreateFromJpeg routines, thanks to Christian
Aberger for more efficient pointer arithmetic.
<li>gdtestft correctly builds without PNG tests if PNG support is not present.
Thanks to Gabriele Verzeletti.
</ul>
<P>
<A NAME="whatsnew2.0.9"><H3>What's new in version 2.0.9?</H3></A>
<P>
<ul>
<li>Version 2.0.9 contains a fix to gdImageCopyResized which allows
correct results when copying a palette-based image with a single
transparent index into a truecolor image. Thanks to Thorben
Kundinger.
<li>More <code>configure</code> fixes from Lars Hecking. Thanks, Lars. 
</ul>
<P>
<A NAME="whatsnew2.0.8"><H3>What's new in version 2.0.8?</H3></A>
<P>
<ul>
<li>Version 2.0.8 contains additional fixes to the 'configure' script,
allowing a clean out-of-the-box build on more systems.
<li>Version 2.0.8 adds the new 
<a href="#gdImageCopyRotated">gdImageCopyRotated</a> function, which
can rotate any rectangular image region by an arbitrary number of degrees.
</ul>
<P>
<A NAME="whatsnew2.0.7"><H3>What's new in version 2.0.7?</H3></A>
<P>
Version 2.0.7 corrects a problem which caused 'configure' to complain
that the directory NONE was not found, in various places, causing
the configuration process to stop. There are no code changes.
<P>
<A NAME="whatsnew2.0.6"><H3>What's new in version 2.0.6?</H3></A>
<P>
<ul>
<li>
Fixed a compilation problem with gdft.c. A declaration appeared
after executable code, and gcc let it slide by, so it made it
out the door. My apologies!
<li>As penance, I have seen to it that the entire library
now compiles cleanly with the <code>-Wall</code>, <code>-ansi</code>
and <code>-pedantic</code> options enabled.
</ul>
<p>
<A NAME="whatsnew2.0.5"><H3>What's new in version 2.0.5?</H3></A>
<ul>
<li>libgd 2.0.5 INSTALLS IN /usr/local/lib BY DEFAULT. IF YOU WANT
IT TO INSTALL IN /usr/lib, YOU MUST SPECIFY THIS at
<code>configure</code> time using this syntax:
<p>
<code>./configure --prefix=/usr</code> 
<li>gd now uses GNU autoconf. This means that the provided
<code>configure</code> script should be compatible with all standard
GNU configure options and will figure out the correct settings for a
much wider range of operating systems. Many, many thanks to
Lars Hecking for taking care of this.
<li>The <a href="#gdImageStringFTEx">gdImageStringFTEx</a> function
is now included, thanks to Wez Furlong. My apologies to Wez for the
unreasonable amount of time this patch has sat in my queue.
<li>Additional fixes from Wez Furlong.
<li>Arithmetic cleanup by Doug Claar.
<li>Corrections to loading and saving of alpha channel
information in PNG files, by Andrew Hull.
<li>gdImageTrueColorToPalette does not contain
unneeded test code.
<li>gdImageCopyResized works properly again when copying
from a non-truecolor source.
</ul>
<P>
<A NAME="whatsnew2.0.4"><H3>What's new in version 2.0.4?</H3></A>
The following contributions from John Ellson:
<ul>
<li>Various test programs now compile in the absence
of PNG support
<li>gdIOCtx correctly calls gdFree rather than free
<li>Various cleanups to pass -Wall without warnings
<li>Support for Adobe-style Type 1 fonts (.pfa and .pfb files)
via freetype
<li>gdImageColorResolve and gdImageColorResolveAlpha will not
attempt to resolve a color request to the transparent color index
(for palette-based images)
<li>Improved font search path support
<li>Antialiased freetype text on palette images works properly
when more than one image is created in a single program lifetime
with different color indexes
<li>Better threshold for two-color "mono" images 
<li>Memory leak fixes
<li>Text rotation fix
<li>More extensive default font path
<li>fontwheeltest and fontsizetest test programs for freetype
</ul>
And the following additional fixes:
<ul>
<li><code>configure</code> now correctly detects and provides
support for the Xpm library and its dependencies (Len Makin)
</ul>
<A NAME="whatsnew2.0.3"><H3>What's new in version 2.0.3?</H3></A>
<ul>
<li>The <code>configure</code> script has been extensively modified
to work properly in tests with both Solaris and Linux. Other platforms
should also work based on feedback received and integrated to date.
<li>The <code>--prefix</code> option to <code>configure</code>
works properly.
<li>The <code>annotate</code> utility has been added. This is a
very handy tool for adding freetype text to existing JPEGs. After
<code>make install</code>, type <code>annotate -h</code> for more 
information. Thanks to Joel Dubiner.
</ul>
<P>
<A NAME="whatsnew2.0.2"><H3>What's new in version 2.0.2?</H3></A>
<ul>
<li>A "configure" script has been added. After wrestling with GNU
autoconf for a while, I got tired of trying to make it detect libraries
but accept their absence gracefully, and so on. Instead, I wrote a short
Perl script which does the job and builds a reasonable Makefile. Those
who find it doesn't detect their system's needs properly are welcome
to contribute patches or the necessary commands.
<li>Antialiased freetype text output now works properly in both
truecolor and non-truecolor contexts! Hurrah! On a truecolor image
it is possible, for instance, to draw antialiased text on an arbitrarily
complex background with 50% alpha blending (transparency), and get the
expected pretty results. Thanks to Joel Dubiner for his support of this work.
<li><strong>By default, alpha blending is now done within the library.</strong>
Also, by default, alpha channel is not saved with PNG images. This means
that programmers who try loading a JPEG, scribbling some pretty antialiased
text on it, and saving the JPEG again will now get the results they
expected. It also means that, by default, users will not run afoul of
the fact that many web browsers don't properly support full PNG alpha
channel. 
<li>Various submitted bug fixes have been incorporated.
<li>Various other submitted changes have not been incorporated. Sorry.
The interval between 2.0.1 and 2.0.2 was simply too long, and changes
accumulated which were not mutually compatible. I'll do better in
the future, especially with bug fixes.
</ul> 
<P><A NAME="whatsnew2.0.1"><H3>What's new in version 2.0.1?</H3></A>
<ul>
<li>Workaround for a bug in gcc, apparently found in gcc 2.7.2 and up.
I reproduced and fixed it while using gcc 2.9.5.2. The bug occurred only
when the -g option was in use. This problem caused gcc to spew
internal error messages unrelated to the correctness of the code
in gd_gd2.c. Howard Jones was first to report it.
<li><a href="#gdImageFilledEllipse">gdImageFilledEllipse</a> documented
and altered; no longer requires a superfluous style argument. Thanks to
Francis James Franklin.
<li>The Makefile now offers the correct syntax for
optionally creating a static library. Thanks to Jean-Lous Regez,
among others.
<li>A nested comment, an attempt to return the value of a void function,
and a potentially significant error in gdImageCopyResampled were fixed
thanks to Joseph Shirley.
<li>A bug preventing proper truecolor text rendering was fixed,
thanks to Jason Gallagher.
<li><a href="#gdImageStringFT">gdImageStringFT</a> (FreeType) should 
now work better against a transparent or semitransparent background,
and should act in a manner consistent with the most recent
<a href="#gdImageAlphaBlending">gdImageAlphaBlending</a> setting.
Antialiasing is now done via the alpha channel mechanism if the
image is a truecolor image. 
<li>Bugs in the output of gdImageArc and gdImageFilledArc were reported
by Bruce Verderaime. A simple and correct but inefficient implementation
has been substituted until fixes are contributed for the faster code,
which is in gd_arc_f_buggy.c along with the test program that reproduces
the bug(s).
<li><a href="#gdImageFilledArc">gdImageFilledArc</a> now offers additional
style options, which can be combined to produce various effects.  
<li>Masahito Yamaga (ma@yama-ga.com) sent a patch to improve
support for Japanese output via <a href="#gdImageStringFT">gdImageStringFT</a>. 
He also added a new <code>readme.jpn</code> file.
<li>Zillions of documentation fixes.
</ul>
<P><A NAME="whatsnew2.0"><H3>What's new in version 2.0?</H3></A>
<ul>
<li><strong>Support for truecolor images!</strong> Version 2.0 can
load truecolor PNGs with no loss of color information, and almost
no loss of alpha channel information. Version 2.0 can also load
truecolor JPEGs with as little loss as possible; however, bear in
mind that JPEG is a lossy format, so repeated load/save cycles
always reduce image quality. This is not a bug. To create
a truecolor image from scratch, call the new
<a href="#gdImageCreateTrueColor">gdImageCreateTrueColor</a>
function. The <a href="#gdImageCreate">gdImageCreate</a> function
is still available to create palette images, and may also be
referred to as <a href="#gdImageCreatePalette">gdImageCreatePalette</a>.
<li><strong>Support for alpha channels!</strong> In addition to
24 bits of color information for each pixel (eight bits of
red, green, and blue respectively), version 2.0 supports
7 bits of "alpha channel" information. This is used to determine
exactly how transparent the pixel should be. There is also support
for a full 7 bits of transparency for each individual palette index
in a palette-based image. Please note that, as of this writing,
only Macintosh Internet Explorer 5.x and Mozilla/Netscape 6.x
display partial transparency properly.
<li>The new <a href="#gdImageAlphaBlending">gdImageAlphaBlending</a>
function allows for two different modes of drawing. In blending mode,
the alpha channel component of the color supplied to all drawing
functions, such as <a href="#gdImageSetPixel">gdImageSetPixel</a>,
determines how much of the underlying color should be allowed to
shine through. The resulting image is not transparent. In non-blending 
mode, drawing color is copied literally with the alpha channel 
information, resulting in a transparent image. Blending mode is
not available when drawing on palette images. 
<li>The <a href="#gdImageCopyResampled">gdImageCopyResampled</a>
function provides "smooth" copying from a large image to a smaller
one, using a weighted average of the pixels of the source area rather 
than selecting one representative pixel. This function is identical
to <a href="#gdImageCopyResized">gdImageCopyResized</a> when the
destination image is a palette image.
<li>The <a href="#gdImageTrueColorToPalette">gdImageTrueColorToPalette</a>
function converts a truecolor image to a palette image. The code for
this function was originally drawn from the Independent JPEG Group library
code, which is excellent. The code has been modified to preserve as much
alpha channel information as possible in the resulting palette, in addition 
to preserving colors as well as possible. This does not work as well as
might be hoped. It is usually best to simply produce a truecolor
output image instead, which guarantees the highest output quality.
<li>A very high degree of backwards compatibility with existing
gd 1.x code has been maintained, at both the source code and binary
level. <strong>Code which directly accesses the <code>pixels</code> array
will fail only if it encounters an existing truecolor image</strong>, which may
happen if the code attempts to open and modify an existing JPEG or 
truecolor PNG. Such code should be modified to check the
<code>trueColor</code> flag of the <code>gdImage</code> structure, and
refer to the <code>tpixels</code> array instead when it is set.
<li>gd is now compiled and installed as a shared library. However,
gd still does not use autoconf, because I (TBB) have very limited
patience with autoconf. These days, most Unix systems provide a fairly
POSIX-standard environment, and the provided Makefile is likely to work well
if users read it and follow the instructions at the top.
<li>Support for line thickness was added by Michael Schwartz. My apologies
to him for sitting on his patches for so long. See the new
<a href="#gdImageSetThickness">gdImageSetThickness</a> function, which
affects all standard gd functions that draw lines and curves. In addition,
Michael added a convenient <a href="#gdImageEllipse">gdImageEllipse</a>
function. 
<li>The new <a href="#gdImageFilledArc">gdImageFilledArc</a> function
provides a straightforward way to draw filled arcs. Also,
<a href="#gdImageFilledEllipse">gdImageFilledEllipse</a> is a 
convenient way to fill an ellipse without specifying starting
and ending angles. Thanks go out to F J Franklin.
<li>To put an end to the confusion, TrueType 1.x support has been
removed in favor of TrueType 2.x support. The old
gdImageStringTTF function simply invokes gdImageStringFT.
<li>The specialized .gd and .gd2 file formats have been upgraded to support
truecolor. New images written by the versions of these functions
found in 2.0 will be rejected, with varying degrees of grace, by
older versions of gd. THIS AFFECTS THE .GD and .GD2 FORMATS ONLY. IF YOU
ARE CONFUSED BY THIS PARAGRAPH, IT PROBABLY DOESN'T APPLY TO ANYTHING
YOU WILL EVER ENCOUNTER. Since these file formats are absolutely,
positively *not* designed for distributing images, just for
preprocessing them, this should not be a big problem. gd 2.0 should
read old .gd and .gd2 files correctly.
</ul>
<P><A NAME="whatsnew1.8.4"><H3>What's new in version 1.8.4?</H3></A>

Makefile fixes to permit
linking with all libraries required on platforms with order-

<P><A NAME="whatsnew1.7.1"><H3>What's new in version 1.7.1?</H3></A>
A minor buglet in the Makefile was corrected, as well as an inaccurate
error message in <code>gdtestttf.c</code>. Thanks to Masahito Yamaga.
<P><A NAME="whatsnew1.7"><H3>What's new in version 1.7?</H3></A>
Version 1.7 contains the following changes:
<ul>
<li>Japanese language support for the TrueType functions.
Thanks to Masahito Yamaga.
<li><code>autoconf</code> and <code>configure</code> have been removed, in favor of a 
carefully designed Makefile which produces and properly installs
the library and the binaries. System-dependent variables are
at the top of the Makefile for easy modification. I'm sorry, 
folks, but autoconf generated <strong>many, many confused email 
messages</strong> from people who didn't have things where autoconf 
expected to find them. I am not an autoconf/automake wizard, and 
gd is a simple, very compact library which does not need to 
be a shared library. I <strong>did</strong> make many improvements
over the old gd 1.3 Makefile, which were directly inspired by the 
autoconf version found in the 1.6 series (thanks to John Ellson).
<li>Completely ANSI C compliant, according to the <code>-pedantic-errors</code>
flag of gcc. Several pieces of not-quite-ANSI-C code were causing problems
for those with non-gcc compilers.
<li><code>gdttf.c</code> patched to allow the use of Windows symbol
fonts, when present (thanks to Joseph Peppin). 
<li><code>extern "C"</code> wrappers added to <code>gd.h</code> and the
font header files for the convenience of C++ programmers. 
<code>bdftogd</code> was also modified to automatically insert these
wrappers into future font header files. Thanks to John Lindal.
<li>Compiles correctly on platforms that don't define <code>SEEK_SET</code>.
Thanks to Robert Bonomi.
<li>Loads Xpm images via the 
<a href="#gdImageCreateFromXpm"><code>gdImageCreateFromXpm</code></a>
function, if the Xpm library is available. Thanks to Caolan McNamara.
</ul>
<P><A NAME="whatsnew1.6.3"><H3>What's new in version 1.6.3?</H3></A>
Version 1.6.3 corrects a memory leak in gd_png.c. This leak caused
a significant amount of memory to be allocated and not freed when
writing a PNG image. 
<P><A NAME="whatsnew1.6.2"><H3>What's new in version 1.6.2?</H3></A>
Version 1.6.2 from John Ellson <ellson@graphviz.org> adds two new functions:
<ul>
<li>gdImageStringTTF - scalable, rotatable, anti-aliased, TrueType strings using
the FreeType library, but only if libttf is found by configure.
<strong>We do not provide TrueType fonts. Obtaining them
is entirely up to you.</strong>
<li>gdImageColorResolve - an efficient alternative for the
common code fragment:
<pre>

      if ((color=gdImageColorExact(im,R,G,B)) < 0)
          if ((color=gdImageColorAllocate(im,R,G,B)) < 0)
              color=gdImageColorClosest(im,R,G,B);
</pre>
</ul>
<p>
Also in this release the build process has been converted to
GNU autoconf/automake/libtool conventions so that both (or either)
static and shared libraries can be built.
<P><A NAME="whatsnew1.6.1"><H3>What's new in version 1.6.1?</H3></A>
Version 1.6.1 incorporates superior PNG reading and writing code
from Greg Roelofs, with minor modifications by Tom Boutell. 
Specifically, I altered his code to read non-palette images
(converting them to palette images badly, by dithering them),
and to tolerate palette images with types of transparency that
gd doesn't actually support (it just ignores the advanced
transparency features). Any bugs in this area are therefore my 
fault, not Greg's.
<p>
Unlike gd 1.6, users should have no trouble linking with
gd 1.6.1 if they follow the instructions and install all of
the pieces. However, <strong>If you get undefined symbol errors,
be sure to check for older versions of libpng in your
library directories!</strong>
<P><A NAME="whatsnew1.6"><H3>What's new in version 1.6?</H3></A>
Version 1.6 features the following changes:
<p>
<strong>Support for 8-bit palette PNG images has been added.
Support for GIF has been removed.</strong> This step was taken
to completely avoid the legal controversy regarding the LZW
compression algorithm used in GIF. Unisys holds a patent which
is relevant to LZW compression. PNG is a superior image format
in any case. Now that PNG is supported by both Microsoft
Internet Explorer and Netscape (in their recent releases),
we highly recommend that GD users upgrade in order to get 
well-compressed images in a format which is legally unemcumbered.

<P><A NAME="whatsnew1.5"><H3>What's new in version 1.5?</H3></A>

Version 1.5 featured the following changes:

<dl>
<dt><b>New GD2 format</b>
<dd>      An improvement over the GD format, the GD2 format uses the zlib
          compression library to compress the image in chunks. This results
          in file sizes comparable to GIFs, with the ability to access parts
          of large images without having to read the entire image into memory.
<p>
  This format also supports version numbers and rudimentary validity
  checks, so it should be more 'supportable' than the previous GD format.
<p>
<dt><b>Re-arranged source files</b>
<dd>      gd.c has been broken into constituant parts: io, gif, gd, gd2 and
          graphics functions are now in separate files.
<p>
<dt><b>Extended I/O capabilities.</b>
<dd>      The source/sink feature has been extended to support GD2 file formats (which
          require seek/tell functions; seek must return 1 for success, 0 for failure), and to allow more general non-file I/O.
<p>
<dt><b>Better support for Lincoln Stein's Perl Module</b>
<dd>      The new gdImage*Ptr function returns the chosen format stored in a block of memory.
          This can be directly used by the GD perl module.
<p>
<dt><b>Added functions</b>
<dd>gdImageCreateFromGd2Part - allows retrieval of part of an image (good for huge images, like maps),
<br>gdImagePaletteCopy - Copies a palette from one image to another, doing it's best to match the colors in the target image to the colors in the source palette.
<br>gdImageGd2, gdImageCreateFromGd2 - Support for new format
<br>gdImageCopyMerge - Merges two images (useful to highlight part of an image)
<br>gdImageCopyMergeGray - Similar to gdImageCopyMerge, but tries to preserve source image hue.
<br>gdImagePngPtr, gdImageJpegPtr, gdImageWBMPPtr, gdImageGdPtr, gdImageGd2Ptr - return memory blocks for each type of image.
<br>gdImageCreateFromPngCtx, gdImageCreateFromGdCtx, gdImageCreateFromGd2Ctx, gdImageCreateFromGd2PartCtx - Support for new I/O context.

</dl>

<b>NOTE:</b> In fairness to Thomas Boutell, any bug/problems with any of the above features should
probably be reported to <a href=mailto:pjw@rhyme.com.au>Philip Warner</a>.

<P><A NAME="whatsnew1.4"><H3>What's new in version 1.4?</H3></A>

Version 1.4 features the following changes:
<dl>
<dt>Fixed polygon fill routine (again)
<dd>Thanks to Kirsten Schulz, version 1.4 is able to fill
numerous types of polygons that caused problems with
previous releases, including version 1.3.
<dt>Support for alternate data sources
<dd>Programmers who wish to load a GIF from something other
than a stdio FILE * stream can use the new
<a href="#gdImageCreateFromPngSource">gdImageCreateFromPngSource</a> function.
<dt>Support for alternate data destinations
<dd>Programmers who wish to write a GIF to something other
than a stdio FILE * stream can use the new
<a href="#gdImagePngToSink">gdImagePngToSink</a> function.
<dt>More tolerant when reading GIFs
<dd>
Version 1.4 does not crash when reading certain animated GIFs,
although it still only reads the first frame. Version 1.4 also has
overflow testing code to prevent crashes when reading
damaged GIFs.
</dl>
<P><A NAME="whatsnew1.3"><H3>What's new in version 1.3?</H3></A>
Version 1.3 features the following changes:
<dl>
<dt>Non-LZW-based GIF compression code
<dd>
Version 1.3 contained GIF compression code that uses simple Run Length
Encoding instead of LZW compression, while still retaining compatibility
with normal LZW-based GIF decoders (your browser will still like your GIFs).
<strong>LZW compression is patented by Unisys. We are currently reevaluating
the approach taken by gd 1.3. The current release of gd does not support
this approach. We recommend that you use the current release, and generate
PNG images.</strong> Thanks to 
Hutchison Avenue Software Corporation for contributing
the RLE GIF code.
<dt>8-bit fonts, and 8-bit font support
<dd>This improves support for European languages. Thanks are due
to Honza Pazdziora <adelton@informatics.muni.cz> and also to
Jan Pazdziora <adelton@fi.muni.cz>. Also see the provided bdftogd
Perl script if you wish to convert fixed-width X11 fonts
to gd fonts.
<dt>16-bit font support (no fonts provided)
<dd>Although no such fonts are provided in the distribution,
fonts containing more than 256 characters should work if the
gdImageString16 and gdImageStringUp16 routines are used.
<dt>Improvements to the "webpng" example/utility
<dd>The "webpng" utility is now a slightly more useful application. Thanks to
Brian Dowling for this code.
<dt>Corrections to the color resolution field of GIF output
<dd>Thanks to Bruno Aureli.
<dt>Fixed polygon fills
<dd>A one-line patch for the infamous polygon fill bug, courtesy
of Jim Mason. I believe this fix is sufficient. However, if you
find a situation where polygon fills still fail to behave properly,
please send code that demonstrates the problem, <em>and</em> a fix if
you have one. Verifying the fix is important.
<dt>Row-major, not column-major
<dd>Internally, gd now represents the array of pixels as
an array of rows of pixels, rather than an array of columns
of pixels. This improves the performance of compression and
decompression routines slightly, because horizontally adjacent
pixels are now next to each other in memory. <strong>This should
not affect properly written gd applications, but applications that
directly manipulate the <code>pixels</code> array will require
changes.</strong>
</dl>
<A NAME="required"><H3>What else do I need to use gd?</H3></A>
<P>
To use gd, you will need an ANSI C compiler. <strong>All popular
Windows 95 and NT C compilers are ANSI C compliant.</strong> Any
full-ANSI-standard C compiler should be adequate. <strong>The cc
compiler released with SunOS 4.1.3 is not an ANSI C compiler.
Most Unix users who do not already have gcc should get it.
gcc is free, ANSI compliant and a de facto industry standard.
Ask your ISP why it is missing.</strong>
<P>
As of version 1.6, you also need the zlib compression library,
and the libpng library. As of version 1.6.2, you can draw text
using antialiased TrueType fonts if you also have the libttf
library installed, but this is not mandatory.
zlib is available for a variety of platforms from
<a href="http://www.freesoftware.com/pub/infozip/index.html">the zlib web site</a>.
libpng is available for a variety of platforms from
<a href="http://www.cdrom.com/pub/png/">the PNG web site</a>.

<P>
You will also want a PNG viewer, if you do not already have
one for your system, since you will need a good way to check the
results of your work. Netscape 4.04 and higher, and Microsoft
Internet Explorer 4.0 or higher, both support PNG.
<strong>Not every PNG-compatible viewer supports alpha channel
transparency,</strong> which is why gd 2.0.2 and above do alpha
blending in the library by default; it is possible to turn on the
saving of alpha channel information to the file instead.

Win32 DLL users: if you are using MSVC, use the provided batch file
<code>makemsvcimport.bat</code> to make a bgd.lib import library
corresponding to the provided bgd.dll. Copy bgd.dll to your
application directory, or to your Windows sytem directory. In the
settings of your MSVC project, you <b>MUST</b> choose the
"multithreaded DLL" library option under "code generation." 
mingw32 and cygwin users can simply link with the provided libbgd.a 
stub library in order to use the DLL.
</blockquote>
Building gd From the Source
<p>
In order to build gd, you must first unpack the archive you have
downloaded. If you are not familiar with <code>tar</code> and
<code>gunzip</code> (Unix) or <code>ZIP</code> (Windows), please
consult with an experienced user of your system. Sorry, we cannot
answer questions about basic Internet skills.
<p>
Unpacking the archive will produce a directory called "gd-2.0.33".
<p>
<h4>For Unix</h4>
<code>cd</code> to the 2.0.33 directory and type:
<p>
<code>./configure</code>
<P>
<blockquote>
<STRONG>NOTE: BY DEFAULT, THE LIBRARY IS INSTALLED IN 
<code>/usr/local/lib</code></strong> and the include files are
installed in <code>/usr/local/include</code>. IF YOU ARE
UPGRADING, you may wish to use:
<pre>
./configure --prefix=/usr
</pre>
Rather than just <code>./configure</code>, before typing
<code>make</code> and <code>make install</code>.
</blockquote>
<p>
If all goes well, this will create a Makefile. If all does not go well --
for instance, if neither the the JPEG nor the PNG and ZLIB libraries
are found -- you will need to install those libraries, then come back
and run <code>configure</code> again. 
<p>
If necessary, make changes to the resulting Makefile. Then, 
type "make". If there are no errors, follow this with "make install". 
Because gd 2.0 and above installs as a shared library, it is necessary to 
install the library properly before running gd-based programs.
<p>
If you get errors, type <code>./configure --help</code> for more
information about the available options. In the unlikely event
that the GNU autoconf-produced configure script does not work well
for you, you may wish to try <code>configure.pl</code>, a
simple Perl script with similar but less complete capabilities.
If all else fails, try renaming <code>makefile.sample</code>
to <code>Makefile</code>. However, <code>./configure</code> is
almost always your best bet.
<blockquote>
<h4>For Windows</h4>
Use the DLL version! See the paragraph at the beginning of this sectino.
If you really want to compile it yourself for some strange reason, read on.
<p>
Create a project using your favorite programming environment.
Copy all of the gd files to the project directory. Add <code>gd.c</code>
to your project. Add other source files as appropriate. Learning the
basic skills of creating projects with your chosen C environment
is up to you. Alternatively, use the free <code>mingw32</code> 
or <code>cygwin</code> tools, which may prove to be compatible
with the provided <code>configure</code> script.
</blockquote>
<P>
If you wish to test the library, type "make test" AFTER you have
successfully executed "make install". This will build
several test programs, including "gddemo". (Not all of these
programs are expected to print completely successful messages,
depending on the nature of the image formats with which some of
the tests are tried; for instance, WBMP is a black and white
format, so loss of color information is expected there.)
Run gddemo to see some of the capabilities of gd. Run
gdtestft to play with the freetype support, if you have built
gd with it and have access to truetype fonts.
<P>
gddemo should execute without incident, creating the file
demoout.png. (Note there is also a file named demoin.png,
which is provided in the package as part of the demonstration.)
<P>
Display demoout.png in your PNG viewer. The image should
be 128x128 pixels and should contain an image of the
space shuttle with quite a lot of graphical elements drawn
on top of it.
<P>
(If you are missing the demoin.png file, the other items
should appear anyway.)
<P>
Look at demoin.png to see the original space shuttle
image which was scaled and copied into the output image.
<P>
<A NAME="basics"><H3>gd basics: using gd in your program</H3></A>
gd lets you create PNG or JPEG images on the fly. To use gd in your
program, include the file gd.h, and link with the gd
library and the other required libraries; the syntax for
most Unix flavors is:
<pre>
-lgd -lpng -lz -ljpeg -lfreetype -lm
</pre>
Assuming that all of these libraries are available.
<P>
If you want to use the provided simple fonts, include
gdfontt.h, gdfonts.h, gdfontmb.h, gdfontl.h and/or gdfontg.h. For
more impressive results, install FreeType 2.x and use the 
<a href="#gdImageStringFT">gdImageStringFT</a>
function. If you are not using the provided Makefile and/or a 
library-based approach, be sure to include the source modules as well in your
project. (They may be too large for 16-bit memory models,
that is, 16-bit DOS and Windows.)
<P>
Here is a short example program. <strong>(For a more advanced example,
see gddemo.c, included in the distribution. gddemo.c is NOT the same program;
it demonstrates additional features!)</strong>
<P>
<PRE>
/* Bring in gd library functions */
#include "gd.h"

When executed, this program creates an image, allocates
two colors (the first color allocated becomes the background
color), draws a diagonal line (note that 0, 0 is the upper
left corner), writes the image to PNG and JPEG files, and
destroys the image.
<P>

in the following reference chapters, complete with code
snippets demonstrating each. There is also an

The data structure in which gd stores images. <A HREF="#gdImageCreate">
gdImageCreate</A>, <a href="#gdImageCreateTrueColor">gdImageCreateTrueColor</a>
and the various image file-loading functions return
a pointer to this type, and the other functions expect to receive
a pointer to this type as their first argument. It is reasonably safe to
examine any of the members of this structure. It is also reasonably
safe to modify individual pixels within the <code>pixels</code> 
or <code>tpixels</code> arrays. If the <code>trueColor</code> flag
is set, the <code>tpixels</code> array is valid; otherwise the
<code>pixels</code> array is valid.
<p>
The <code>colorsTotal</code>, <code>red</code>, <code>green</code>,
<code>blue</code>, <code>alpha</code> and <code>open</code> arrays
manage the palette. They are valid only when the <code>trueColor</code>
flag is not set. 
The <code>transparent</code> value contains the palette index of the first
transparent color as read-only information for backwards compatibility;
gd 2.0 stores this information in the <code>alpha</code> array so that
variable transparency can be supported for each palette entry. However,
for truecolor images, <code>transparent</code> represents a single
RGB color which is <strong>always 100% transparent</strong>, and this
feature is generally supported by browsers which do not support 
full alpha channels.

The order of the structure members may appear confusing, but was chosen
deliberately to increase backwards compatibility with existing gd 1.x-based
binary code that references particular structure members.
<DT><A NAME="gdImagePtr">gdImagePtr</A> <strong>(TYPE)</strong>

argument.
<DT><A NAME="gdIoCtx">gdIOCtx</a> <strong>(TYPE)</strong>
<DD>
Most of the gd functions that read and write files, such as
<a href="#gdImagePng">gdImagePng</a> and <a href="#gdImageCreateFromJpeg"></a>,
also have variants that accept a gdIOCtx structure; see
<a href="#gdImagePngCtx">gdImagePngCtx</a> and 
<a href="#gdImageCreateFromJpegCtx">gdImageCreateFromJpegCtx</a>. Those who wish to provide
their own custom routines to read and write images can populate a
gdIOCtx structure with functions of their own devising to 
to read and write data. For image reading, the only mandatory
functions are getC and getBuf, which must return the number of
characters actually read, or a negative value on error or EOF.
These functions must read the number of characters requested 
unless at the end of the file. For image writing, the only mandatory 
functions are putC and putBuf, which return the number of 
characters written; these functions must write the number of 
characters requested except in the event of an error. The seek
and tell functions are only required in conjunction with the
<code>gd2</code> file format, which supports quick loading of
partial images. The gd_free function will not be invoked when
calling the standard Ctx functions; it is an implementation
convenience when adding new data types to gd. For examples,
see gd_png.c, gd_gd2.c, gd_jpeg.c, etc., all of which rely
on gdIOCtx to implement the standard image read and write functions.

If the PNG image being loaded is a truecolor image, the resulting
gdImagePtr will refer to a truecolor image. If the PNG image
being loaded is a palette or grayscale image, the resulting
gdImagePtr will refer to a palette image. gd retains only 8 bits
of resolution for each of the red, green and blue channels, and
only 7 bits of resolution for the alpha channel. The former
restriction affects only a handful of very rare 48-bit color
and 16-bit grayscale PNG images. The second restriction affects
all semitransparent PNG images, but the difference is essentially
invisible to the eye. 7 bits of alpha channel resolution is,
in practice, quite a lot.

gdImageCreateFromPngSource is called to load a PNG from
a data source other than a file. Usage is very similar to
the <a href="#gdImageCreateFromPng">gdImageCreateFromPng</a> function,
except that the programmer provides a custom data source.
<p>
The programmer must write an input function which accepts
a context pointer, a buffer, and a number of bytes to be
read as arguments. This function must read the number of
bytes requested, unless the end of the file has been reached,
in which case the function should return zero, or an error
has occurred, in which case the function should return
<code>-1</code>. The programmer then creates a
<a href="#gdSource">gdSource</a> structure and sets
the <code>source</code> pointer to the input function and
the context pointer to any value which is useful to the
programmer.
<p>
The example below
implements <a href="#gdImageCreateFromPng">gdImageCreateFromPng</a>
by creating a custom data source and invoking gdImageCreateFromPngSource.

gdImageJpeg outputs the specified image to the specified

If quality is negative, the default IJG JPEG quality value (which
should yield a good general quality / size tradeoff for most
situations) is used.  Otherwise, for practical purposes, quality
should be a value in the range 0-95, higher quality values usually
implying both higher quality and larger image sizes.

produces high quality palettes but does require some CPU time. If you are

<DD>This function must be called as the first function when creating a
GIF animation.  It writes the correct GIF file headers to selected
file output, and prepares for frames to be added for the animation.
The image argument is not used to produce an image frame to the file,
it is only used to establish the GIF animation frame size, interlacing
options and the color palette.  gdImageGifAnimAdd is used to
add the first and subsequent frames to the animation, and the animation
must be terminated by writing a semicolon character (;) to it or by using
gdImageGifAnimEnd to do that.
<p>

The GlobalCM flag indicates if a global color map (or palette) is used
in the GIF89A header.  A nonzero value specifies that a global color
map should be used to reduce the size of the animation.
Of course, if the color maps of
individual frames differ greatly, a global color map may not be a good idea.
GlobalCM=1 means write global color map, GlobalCM=0 means do not, and
GlobalCM=-1 means to do the default, which currently is to use a global
color map.

<p>

If Loops is 0 or greater, the Netscape 2.0 extension for animation
loop count is written.  0 means infinite loop count.  -1 means that
the extension is not added which results in no looping. -1 is the

void gdImageGifAnimAddCtx(gdImagePtr im, gdIOCtx *out, int LocalCM, int LeftOfs, int TopOfs, int Delay, int Disposal, gdImagePtr previm)</A>

<STRONG>(FUNCTION)</STRONG>

<DD> This function writes GIF animation frames to GIF animation, which
was initialized with <a
href="#gdImageGifAnimBegin">gdImageGifAnimBegin</a>.  With LeftOfs and
TopOfs you can place this frame in different offset than (0,0) inside
the image screen as defined in gdImageGifAnimBegin.  Delay between the
previous frame and this frame is in 1/100s units.  Disposal is usually
<code>gdDisposalNone</code>, meaning that the pixels changed by this
frame should remain on the display when the next frame begins to render, but
can also be <code>gdDisposalUnknown</code> (not recommended),
<code>gdDisposalRestoreBackground</code> (restores the first
allocated color of the global palette), or
<code>gdDisposalRestorePrevious</code> (restores the appearance of the
affected area before the frame was rendered). Only
<code>gdDisposalNone</code> is a sensible choice for the first frame.
If <code>previm</code> is
passed, the built-in GIF optimizer will always use <code>gdDisposalNone</code> 
regardless of the Disposal parameter.
<p>
Setting the LocalCM flag to 1 adds a local palette for this image to the 
animation.  Otherwise the global palette is assumed and the user must make 
sure the palettes match.  Use <A HREF="#gdImagePaletteCopy">gdImagePaletteCopy</A> to do that.

<p>

Automatic optimization is activated by giving the previous image as a 
parameter.  This function then compares the images and only writes the changed
pixels to the new frame in animation.  The Disposal parameter for
optimized animations must be set to 1, also for the first frame.
LeftOfs and TopOfs parameters are ignored for optimized frames.  To
achieve good optimization, it is usually best to use a single global 
color map.  To allow gdImageGifAnimAdd to compress unchanged pixels via
the use of a transparent color, the image must include a transparent color.

<strong>(FUNCTION)</strong>
<dd>
gdImagePngToSink is called to write a PNG to
a data "sink" (destination) other than a file. Usage is very similar to
the <a href="#gdImagePng">gdImagePng</a> function,
except that the programmer provides a custom data sink.
<p>
The programmer must write an output function which accepts
a context pointer, a buffer, and a number of bytes to be
written as arguments. This function must write the number of
bytes requested and return that number, unless an error
has occurred, in which case the function should return
<code>-1</code>. The programmer then creates a
<a href="#gdSink">gdSink</a> structure and sets
the <code>sink</code> pointer to the output function and
the context pointer to any value which is useful to the
programmer.
<p>
The example below
implements <a href="#gdImagePng">gdImagePng</a>
by creating a custom data source and invoking gdImagePngFromSink.

The file is stored as a series of compressed subimages, and the
<strong>Chunk Size</strong> determines the sub-image size - a value of

<DD>
<blockquote>
gdImageCreatePaletteFromTrueColor returns a <b>new</b> 
image. gdImageTrueColorToPalette permanently converts the
<b>existing</b> image. The two functions are otherwise identical.
</blockquote>
<p>
The function converts a truecolor image to a palette-based image,
using a high-quality two-pass quantization routine.
If ditherFlag is set, the image will be
dithered to approximate colors better, at the expense
of some obvious "speckling." colorsWanted can be
anything up to 256. If the original source image
includes photographic information or anything that
came out of a JPEG, 256 is strongly recommended. 
100% transparency of a single transparent color in the
original truecolor image will be preserved. There is no other
support for preservation of alpha channel or transparency in
the destination image.
<p>
For best results, don't use this function -- write real
truecolor PNGs and JPEGs. The disk space gain of
conversion to palette is not great (for small images
it can be negative) and the quality loss is ugly. However,
the version of this function included in version 2.0.12 and later does
do a better job than the version included prior to 2.0.12.

gdImageFilledArc is used to draw a partial ellipse centered at the given point,
with the specified width and height in pixels. The arc begins at
the position in degrees specified by <code>s</code> and ends at
the position specified by <code>e</code>. The arc is filled in
the color specified by the second to last argument. A circle can be drawn
by beginning from 0 degrees and ending at 360 degrees, with
width and height being equal. e must be greater than s. Values greater
than 360 are interpreted modulo 360. The last argument is a bitwise
OR of the following possibilities:
<ul>
<li>gdArc
<li>gdChord
<li>gdPie (synonym for gdChord)
<li>gdNoFill
<li>gdEdged
</ul>
gdArc and gdChord are mutually exclusive;
gdChord just connects the starting and ending
angles with a straight line, while gdArc produces
a rounded edge. gdPie is a synonym for gdArc.
gdNoFill indicates that the arc or chord should be
outlined, not filled. gdEdged, used together with
gdNoFill, indicates that the beginning and ending
angles should be connected to the center; this is
a good way to outline (rather than fill) a
'pie slice'.

"Antialiasing" is a process by which jagged edges associated with line
drawing can be reduced by blending the foreground color with an appropriate
percentage of the background, depending on how much of the pixel in question
is actually within the boundaries of the line being drawn. 
All line-drawing functions,
such as <A HREF="#gdImageLine">gdImageLine</A>,
<A HREF="#gdImageOpenPolygon">gdImageOpenPolygon</A> and
<A HREF="#gdImagePolygon">gdImagePolygon</A>, will draw antialiased lines
if the special "color" <A HREF="#gdAntiAliased">
gdAntiAliased</A> is used when calling them.
<P>
gdImageSetAntiAliased is used to specify the actual foreground color
to be used when drawing antialiased lines. You may set any color to
be the foreground, however as of version 2.0.12 an alpha channel
component is not supported. 
<p>
Antialiased lines can be drawn on both truecolor and palette-based
images. However, attempts to draw antialiased lines on 
highly complex palette-based backgrounds may not give satisfactory
results, due to the limited number of colors available in the
palette. Antialiased line-drawing on simple backgrounds should
work well with palette-based images; otherwise create or fetch
a truecolor image instead.
<P>
You need not take any special action when you are finished
with antialised line drawing.

A "brush" is an image used to draw wide, shaped strokes in another image. Just

It is often desirable to draw dashed lines, dotted lines, and other
variations on a broken line. gdImageSetStyle can be used to set
any desired series of colors, including a special color that
leaves the background intact, to be repeated during the drawing
of a line.
<P>
To use gdImageSetStyle, create an array of integers and assign
them the desired series of color values to be repeated.
You can assign the special color value <A HREF="#gdTransparent">
gdTransparent</A> to indicate that the existing color should
be left unchanged for that particular pixel (allowing a dashed
line to be attractively drawn over an existing image).
<P>
Then, to draw a line using the style, use the normal
<A HREF="#gdImageLine">gdImageLine</A> function with the
special color value <A HREF="#gdStyled">gdStyled</A>.
<P>
As of <A HREF="#whatsnew1.1.1">version 1.1.1</A>, the style
array is copied when you set the style, so you need not
be concerned with keeping the array around indefinitely.
This should not break existing code that assumes styles
are not copied.
<P>
You can also combine styles and brushes to draw the brush
image at intervals instead of in a continuous stroke.
When creating a style for use with a brush, the
style values are interpreted differently: zero (0) indicates
pixels at which the brush should not be drawn, while one (1)
indicates pixels at which the brush should be drawn.
To draw a styled, brushed line, you must use the
special color value <A HREF="#gdStyledBrushed">
gdStyledBrushed</A>. For an example of this feature
in use, see gddemo.c (provided in the distribution).

<STRONG>(FUNCTION)</STRONG>
<DD>
The <a href="#gdImageAlphaBlending">gdImageAlphaBlending</a>
function allows for two different modes of drawing on truecolor
images. In blending mode, which is <strong>on by default (gd 2.0.2
and above)</strong>, the alpha channel component of the color 
supplied to all drawing functions, such as 
<a href="#gdImageSetPixel">gdImageSetPixel</a>, determines how much of 
the underlying color should be allowed to shine through. As a result, 
gd automatically blends the existing color at that point with the
drawing color, and stores the result in the image. The resulting pixel
is opaque. In non-blending mode, the drawing color is copied literally 
with its alpha channel information, replacing the destination pixel.
Blending mode is not available when drawing on palette images.

<STRONG>(FUNCTION)</STRONG>
<DD>
By default, gd 2.0.2 and above do not attempt to save full alpha channel information
(as opposed to single-color transparency) when saving PNG images. (PNG
is currently the only output format supported by gd which can accommodate
alpa channel information.) This saves space in the output file. If you wish
to create an image with alpha channel information for use with tools that
support it, call gdImageSaveAlpha(im, 1) to turn on saving of such 
information, and call <a href="#gdImageAlphaBlending">gdImageAlphaBlending(im, 0)</a>
to turn off alpha blending within the library so that alpha channel
information is actually stored in the image rather than being composited
immediately at the time that drawing functions are invoked.
<DT><A NAME="gdImageSetClip">

<STRONG>(FUNCTION)</STRONG>

Establishes a clipping rectangle. Once gdImageSetClip has been called,
all future drawing operations will remain within the specified clipping
area, until a new gdImageSetClip call takes place. For instance, 
if a clipping rectangle of 25, 25, 75, 75 has been set within a
100x100 image, a diagonal line from 0,0 to 99,99 will appear only 
between 25,25 and 75,75.
<p>
If gdImageSetClip is never called, the clipping area will be the
entire image.

The parameters passed to gdImageSetClip are checked against the dimensions
of the image and limited to "safe" values.

For backwards compatibility reasons, the fontlist parameter to those
functions is still expected to be a full or partial font file path name 
or list thereof by default. However, as a convenience, a single call
to gdFTUseFontConfig with a nonzero parameter configures gd to expect
the fontlist parameter to be a fontconfig pattern. Regardless of whether
the flag argument is nonzero, this function returns true when the 
fontconfig library is available and false when it is not. When fontconfig
is not available, the fontlist parameter always behaves as in previous
versions of GD.

<STRONG>(FUNCTION)</STRONG>
<DD>
<strong>RECOMMENDED. New in 1.8.4.</strong> gdImageStringFT draws text using the
FreeType 2.x library.
<p>
gdImageStringFT draws a string of anti-aliased characters on the image using 
the <A HREF=http://www.freetype.org/>FreeType</A>
library to render user-supplied TrueType fonts. <strong>We do not provide 
TrueType fonts (.ttf and .ttc files). Obtaining them is entirely up to 
you.</strong> The string is anti-aliased, meaning that there should be 
fewer "jaggies" visible. The fontname is the full pathname to a TrueType 
font file, or a font face name if the GDFONTPATH environment variable
or the compiled-in DEFAULT_FONTPATH macro of gdft.c have been set intelligently. In the absence of a full path, the font face name may be presented with or without extension (2.0.26).
<p>
The null-terminated <b>string</b> argument is considered to be encoded via the UTF_8
standard; also, HTML entities are supported, including decimal,
hexadecimal, and named entities (2.0.26). Those who are passing 
ordinary ASCII strings may have difficulty with the &amp; 
character unless encoded correctly as &amp; but should have no 
other difficulties.
<p>
The string may be arbitrarily scaled (ptsize) and rotated (angle in radians).
The direction of rotation is counter-clockwise, with 0 radians (0 degrees)
at 3 o'clock and PI/2 radians (90 degrees) at 12 o'clock. 

<p>
The user-supplied int brect[8] array is filled on return from gdImageStringFT
with the 8 elements representing the 4 corner coordinates of the
bounding rectangle (the smallest rectangle that completely surrounds the 
rendered string and does not intersect any pixel of the rendered string).

</TABLE>
<p>
The points are relative to the text regardless of the angle, so "upper left"
means in the top left-hand corner seeing the text horizontally.
<p>
Use a NULL gdImagePtr to get the bounding rectangle without rendering.
This is a relatively cheap operation if followed by a rendering of the same
string, because of the caching of the partial rendering during bounding
rectangle calculation.
<p>
The string is rendered in the color indicated by the gf color index.
<strong>Use the negative of the desired color index to 
disable anti-aliasing.</strong>
<p>
The string may contain UTF-8 sequences like: "&amp;#192;"
<p>
gdImageStringFT will return a null char* on success, or an error
string on failure.

<STRONG>(FUNCTION)</STRONG>
<DD>
<strong>New in 2.0.5,</strong> also found in common third-party versions
of gd. gdImageStringFTEx extends the capabilities of 
<a href="#gdImageStringFT">gdImageStringFT</a> by providing a 
way to pass additional parameters. 
<p>
If the <code>strex</code> parameter is not null, it must point to a
<code>gdFTStringExtra</code> structure. As of gd 2.0.5, this structure
is defined as follows:
<pre>
typedef struct {
       /* logical OR of gdFTEX_ values */
       int flags; 
       /* fine tune line spacing for '\n' */
       double linespacing; 
       /* Preferred character mapping */
       int charmap;
       /* Rendering resolution */
       int hdpi;
       int vdpi;
       char *xshow;
       char *fontpath;
} gdFTStringExtra, *gdFTStringExtraPtr;
</pre>
To output multiline text with a specific line spacing, 
include <code>gdFTEX_LINESPACE</code> in the setting of
<code>flags</code>:
<pre>
flags |= gdFTEX_LINESPACE;
</pre>
And also set <code>linespacing</code> to the desired spacing, expressed as a
multiple of the font height. Thus a line spacing of 1.0 is the
minimum to guarantee that lines of text do not collide.
<p>
If <code>gdFTEX_LINESPACE</code> is not present, or 
<code>strex</code> is null, or <a href="#gdImageStringFT">gdImageStringFT</a>
is called, <code>linespacing</code> defaults to 1.05.
<p>
To specify a preference for Unicode, Shift_JIS Big5 character encoding,
set or To output multiline text with a specific line spacing, 
include <code>gdFTEX_CHARMAP</code> in the setting of
<code>flags</code>:
<pre>
flags |= gdFTEX_CHARMAP;
</pre>
And set <code>charmap</code> to the desired value, which can be
any of gdFTEX_Unicode, gdFTEX_Shift_JIS, gdFTEX_Big5, or gdFTEX_Adobe_Custom.
If you do not specify a preference, Unicode will be tried first. If the preferred
character mapping is not found in the font, other character mappings 
are attempted.
<p>
GD operates on the assumption that the output image will be
rendered to a computer screen. By default, gd passes a
resolution of 96 dpi to the freetype text rendering engine. 
This influences the "hinting" decisions made by the renderer. To
specify a different resolution, set hdpi and vdpi accordingly
(in dots per inch) and add <code>gdFTEX_RESOLUTION</code> to <code>flags</code>:
<pre>
flags | gdFTEX_RESOLUTION;
</pre>
GD 2.0.29 and later will normally attempt to apply kerning tables, if 
fontconfig is available, to adjust the relative positions of consecutive 
characters more ideally for that pair of characters. This can be turn off by
specifying the gdFTEX_DISABLE_KERNING flag:
<pre>
flags | gdFTEX_DISABLE_KERNING;
</pre>
GD 2.0.29 and later can return a vector of individual character
position advances, occasionally useful in applications that must know
exactly where each character begins. This is returned in the xshow
element of the gdFTStringExtra structure if the gdFTEX_XSHOW
flag is set:
<pre>
flags | gdFTEX_XSHOW;
</pre>
<b>The caller is responsible for calling gdFree() on the xshow
element after the call</b> if gdFTEX_XSHOW is set.
<p>
GD 2.0.29 and later can also return the path to the actual font file
used if the gdFTEX_RETURNFONTPATHNAME flag is set. This is useful because 
GD 2.0.29 and above are capable of
selecting a font automatically based on a fontconfig font pattern
when fontconfig is available. This information is returned in the
fontpath element of the gdFTStringExtra structure. 
<pre>
flags | gdFTEX_RETURNFONTPATHNAME;
</pre>
<b>The caller is responsible for calling gdFree() on the fontpath
element after the call</b> if gdFTEX_RETURNFONTPATHNAME is set.
<p>
GD 2.0.29 and later can use fontconfig to resolve
font names, including fontconfig patterns, if the gdFTEX_FONTCONFIG
flag is set. As a convenience, this behavior can be made the default
by calling <a href="#gdFTUseFontConfig">gdFTUseFontConfig</a> with
a nonzero value. In that situation it is not necessary to set the
gdFTEX_FONTCONFIG flag on every call; however explicit font path names
can still be used if the gdFTEX_FONTPATHNAME flag is set:
<pre>
flags | gdFTEX_FONTPATHNAME;
</pre>
<p>
Unless <a href="#gdFTUseFontConfig">gdFTUseFontConfig</a> has been
called with a nonzero value, GD 2.0.29 and later will still expect
the fontlist argument to the freetype text output functions to be
a font file name or list thereof as in previous versions. If you do
not wish to make fontconfig the default, it is
still possible to force the use of fontconfig for a single call to
the freetype text output functions by setting the gdFTEX_FONTCONFIG
flag:
<pre>
flags | gdFTEX_FONTCONFIG;
</pre>
GD 2.0.29 and above can use fontconfig to resolve
font names, including fontconfig patterns, if the gdFTEX_FONTCONFIG
flag is set. As a convenience, this behavior can be made the default
by calling <a href="#gdFTUseFontConfig">gdFTUseFontConfig</a> with
a nonzero value. In that situation it is not necessary to set the

<code>radius</code>, with its center at <code>cx</code> and <code>cy</code>. 
<code>top</code> is written clockwise
along the top; <code>bottom</code> is written counterclockwise
along the bottom. <code>textRadius</code> determines the "height"
of each character; if <code>textRadius</code> is 1/2 of 
<code>radius</code>,
characters extend halfway from the edge to the center.
<code>fillPortion</code> varies from 0 to 1.0, with useful values
from about 0.4 to 0.9, and determines how much of the
180 degrees of arc assigned to each section of text
is actually occupied by text; 0.9 looks better than
1.0 which is rather crowded. <code>font</code> is a freetype
font; see gdImageStringFT. <code>points</code> is passed to the
freetype engine and has an effect on hinting; although
the size of the text is determined by <code>radius</code>, 
<code>textRadius</code>, and <code>fillPortion</code>, you should 
pass a point size that
"hints" appropriately -- if you know the text will be
large, pass a large point size such as 24.0 to get the
best results. <code>fgcolor</code> can be any color, and may have
an alpha component, do blending, etc.

Returns 0 on success, or an error string otherwise.

<STRONG> (FUNCTION)</STRONG>
<DD>
gdImageCopyMerge is almost identical to <a href=#gdImageCopy>gdImageCopy</a>, except that
it 'merges' the two images by an amount specified in the last parameter. If the last
parameter is 100, then it will function identically to gdImageCopy - the source image replaces
the pixels in the destination.
<p>
If, however, the <strong>pct</strong> parameter is less than 100, then the two images are merged.
With pct = 0, no action is taken.
<p>This feature is most useful to 'highlight' sections of an image by merging a solid color with
pct = 50:

<STRONG> (FUNCTION)</STRONG>
<DD>
gdImageCopyMergeGray is almost identical to <a href=#gdImageCopyMerge>gdImageCopyMerge</a>,
except that when merging images it preserves the hue of the source by converting the destination
pixels to grey scale before the copy operation.

<DT><A NAME="gdImagePaletteCopy">void gdImagePaletteCopy(gdImagePtr dst, gdImagePtr src)
<STRONG> (FUNCTION)</STRONG>
<DD>
Copies a palette from one image to another, attempting to match the colors in the target image
to the colors
in the source palette.
<DT><A NAME="gdImageSquareToCircle">void gdImageSquareToCircle(gdImagePtr im, int radius)</a>
<STRONG> (FUNCTION)</STRONG>
<DD>
<b>im MUST be square, but can have any size.</b> Returns a new image
of width and height radius * 2, in which the X axis of
the original has been remapped to theta (angle) and the Y axis
of the original has been remapped to rho (distance from center).
This is known as a "polar coordinate transform."
See also <a href="#gdImageStringFTCircle">gdImageStringFTCircle</a>, which
uses this function internally.
<DT><A NAME="gdImageSharpen">void gdImageSharpen(gdImagePtr im, int pct)</a>
<STRONG> (FUNCTION)</STRONG>
<DD>
Sharpens the specified image. pct is a sharpening percentage, and
can be greater than 100. Silently does nothing to non-truecolor images.
Silently does nothing for pct<0. Transparency/alpha channel are not
altered.

<DT><A NAME="gdImageCompare">int gdImageCompare(gdImagePtr im1, gdImagePtr im2)
<STRONG> (FUNCTION)</STRONG>
<DD>
gdImageCompare returns a bitmap indicating if the two images are different. The members of the 
bitmap are defined in gd.h, but the most important is GD_CMP_IMAGE, which indicated that the images
will actually appear different when displayed. Other, less important, differences relate to pallette
entries. Any difference in the transparent colour is assumed to make images display differently,
even if the transparent colour is not used.
<PRE>
... Inside a function ...
cmpMask = gdImageCompare(im1, im2);
</PRE>

<DT><A NAME="gdImageInterlace">gdImageInterlace(gdImagePtr im, int interlace)</A> <strong>(FUNCTION)</strong>
<DD>
gdImageInterlace is used to determine whether an image should be stored
in a linear fashion, in which lines will appear on the display from
first to last, or in an interlaced fashion, in which the image
will "fade in" over several passes. By default, images are not
interlaced.  (When writing JPEG images, interlacing implies generating
progressive JPEG files, which are represented as a series of scans of
increasing quality.  Noninterlaced gd images result in regular
[sequential] JPEG data streams.)
<P>
A nonzero value for the interlace argument turns on interlace;
a zero value turns it off. Note that interlace has no effect
on other functions, and has no meaning unless you save the
image in PNG or JPEG format; the gd and xbm formats do not support
interlace.
<P>
When a PNG is loaded with
<A HREF="#gdImageCreateFromPng">gdImageCreateFromPng</A> or a JPEG is
loaded with
<A HREF="#gdImageCreateFromJpeg">gdImageCreateFromJpeg</A>, interlace
will be set according to the setting in the PNG or JPEG file.
<P>
Note that many PNG and JPEG viewers and web browsers do <em>not</em>
support interlace or the incremental display of progressive
JPEGs. However, the interlaced PNG or progressive JPEG should still
display; it will simply appear all at once, just as other images do.
<PRE>

/* ... Create or load the image... */

/* Now turn on interlace */

<DT><A NAME="gdFree">gdFree(void *ptr)</A> <strong>(FUNCTION)</strong>
<DD>
gdFree provides a reliable way to free memory allocated by functions
such as <a href="#gdImagePngPtr">gdImagePngPtr</a> which return
blocks of memory. Use of this function guarantees that the
version of <code>free()</code> that is ultimately called will
be intended for use with the version of <code>malloc()</code> that
originally allocated the block. 
</DL>
<H3><A NAME="constants">Constants</A></H3>
<DL>
<DT><A NAME="gdAntiAliased">gdAntiAliased</A> <strong>(CONSTANT)</strong>
<DD>
Used in place of a color when invoking a line-drawing
function such as <A HREF="#gdImageLine">gdImageLine</A>
or <A HREF="#gdImageRectangle">gdImageRectangle</A>.
When gdAntiAliased is used as the color, the foreground color
set with <a href="#gdImageSetAntiAliased">gdImageSetAntiAliased</a>
is used, with antialiasing mechanisms to minimize any
"jagged" appearance. 
For more information, see
<a href="#gdImageSetAntiAliased">gdImageSetAntiAliased</a>.
<DT><A NAME="gdBrushed">gdBrushed</A> <strong>(CONSTANT)</strong>
<DD>
Used in place of a color when invoking a line-drawing
function such as <A HREF="#gdImageLine">gdImageLine</A>
or <A HREF="#gdImageRectangle">gdImageRectangle</A>.
When gdBrushed is used as the color, the brush
image set with <A HREF="#gdImageSetBrush">gdImageSetBrush</A>
is drawn in place of each pixel of the line (the brush is
usually larger than one pixel, creating the effect
of a wide paintbrush). See also
<A HREF="#gdStyledBrushed">gdStyledBrushed</A> for a way
to draw broken lines with a series of distinct copies of an image.
<DT><A NAME="gdMaxColors"><code>gdMaxColors</code><strong>(CONSTANT)</strong>
<DD>
The constant 256. This is the maximum number of colors in a palette-based
PNG file according to the PNG standard, and is also the maximum number of
colors in a palette-based gd image. This of course does not apply to
truecolor images.
<DT><A NAME="gdStyled">gdStyled</A> <strong>(CONSTANT)</strong>
<DD>
Used in place of a color when invoking a line-drawing
function such as <A HREF="#gdImageLine">gdImageLine</A>
or <A HREF="#gdImageRectangle">gdImageRectangle</A>.
When gdStyled is used as the color, the colors of the pixels are
drawn successively from the style that has been
set with <A HREF="#gdImageSetStyle">gdImageSetStyle</A>.
If the color of a pixel is equal to
<A HREF="#gdTransparent">gdTransparent</A>, that pixel
is not altered. (This mechanism is completely unrelated
to the "transparent color" of the image itself; see
<A HREF="#gdImageColorTransparent">gdImageColorTransparent</A>
gdImageColorTransparent for that mechanism.) See also
<A NAME="#gdStyledBrushed"> gdStyledBrushed</A>.
<DT><A NAME="gdStyledBrushed">gdStyledBrushed</A> <strong>(CONSTANT)</strong>
<DD>
Used in place of a color when invoking a line-drawing
function such as <A HREF="#gdImageLine">gdImageLine</A>
or <A HREF="#gdImageRectangle">gdImageRectangle</A>.
When gdStyledBrushed is used as the color, the brush
image set with <A HREF="#gdImageSetBrush">gdImageSetBrush</A>
is drawn at each pixel of the line, providing that the
style set with <A HREF="#gdImageSetStyle">gdImageSetStyle</A>
contains a nonzero value (OR gdTransparent, which
does not equal zero but is supported for consistency)
for the current pixel. (Pixels are drawn successively from the style as the
line is drawn, returning to the beginning when the
available pixels in the style are exhausted.) Note that
this differs from the behavior of <A HREF="#gdStyled">gdStyled</A>,
in which the values in the style are used as actual
pixel colors, except for gdTransparent.
<DT><A NAME="gdDashSize">gdDashSize</A> <strong>(CONSTANT)</strong>
<DD>
The length of a dash in a dashed line. Defined to be 4 for
backwards compatibility with programs that use
<A NAME="gdImageDashedLine">gdImageDashedLine</A>. New
programs should use <A NAME="gdImageSetStyle">
gdImageSetStyle</A> and call the standard
<A NAME="gdImageLine">gdImageLine</A> function
with the special "color" <A NAME="gdStyled">
gdStyled</A> or <A NAME="gdStyledBrushed">gdStyledBrushed</A>.
<DT><A NAME="gdTiled">gdTiled</A> <strong>(CONSTANT)</strong>
<DD>
Used in place of a normal color in <A HREF="#gdImageFilledRectangle">
gdImageFilledRectangle</A>, <A HREF="#gdImageFilledPolygon">
gdImageFilledPolygon</A>,
<A HREF="#gdImageFill">gdImageFill</A>, and <A HREF="#gdImageFillToBorder">
gdImageFillToBorder</A>. gdTiled selects a pixel from the
tile image set with <A HREF="#gdImageSetTile">gdImageSetTile</A>
in such a way as to ensure that the filled area will be
tiled with copies of the tile image. See the discussions of
<A HREF="#gdImageFill">gdImageFill</A> and
<A HREF="#gdImageFillToBorder">gdImageFillToBorder</A> for special
restrictions regarding those functions.
<DT><A NAME="gdTransparent">gdTransparent</A> <strong>(CONSTANT)</strong>
<DD>
Used in place of a normal color in a style to be set with
<A HREF="#gdImageSetStyle">gdImageSetStyle</A>.
gdTransparent is <strong>not</strong> the transparent
color index of the image; for that functionality please
see <A HREF="#gdImageColorTransparent">gdImageColorTransparent</A>.

<A NAME="gdformat"><H3>About the additional .gd image file format</H3></A>
In addition to reading and writing the PNG and JPEG formats and reading the
X Bitmap format, gd has the capability to read and write its
own ".gd" format. This format is <em>not</em> intended for
general purpose use and should never be used to distribute
images. It is not a compressed format. Its purpose is solely to
allow very fast loading of images your program needs often in
order to build other images for output. If you are experiencing
performance problems when loading large, fixed PNG images your
program needs to produce its output images, you may wish
to examine the functions <A HREF="#gdImageCreateFromGd">
gdImageCreateFromGd</A> and <A HREF="#gdImageGd">gdImageGd</A>,
which read and write .gd format images.

<P>
The program "pngtogd.c" is provided as a simple way of converting
.png files to .gd format. I emphasize again that you will not
need to use this format unless you have a need for high-speed loading
of a few frequently-used images in your program.

<A NAME="gd2format"><H3>About the .gd2 image file format</H3></A>
In addition to reading and writing the PNG format and reading the
X Bitmap format, gd has the capability to read and write its
own ".gd2" format. This format is <em>not</em> intended for
general purpose use and should never be used to distribute
images. It is a compressed format allowing pseudo-random access
to large image files. Its purpose is solely to
allow very fast loading of <strong>parts</strong> of images
If you are experiencing
performance problems when loading large, fixed PNG or JPEG images your
program needs to produce its output images, you may wish
to examine the functions <A HREF="#gdImageCreateFromGd2">
gdImageCreateFromGd2</A>, <A HREF="#gdImageCreateFromGd2Part">
gdImageCreateFromGd2Part</A> and <A HREF="#gdImageGd2">gdImageGd2</A>,
which read and write .gd2 format images.

<P>
The program "pngtogd2.c" is provided as a simple way of converting
.png files to .gd2 format.

<A NAME="gdioctx"><H3>About the gdIOCtx structure</H3></A>
Version 1.5 of GD added a new style of I/O based on an IOCtx
structure (the most up-to-date version can be found in gd_io.h):
<PRE>
typedef struct gdIOCtx {
        int     (*getC)(struct gdIOCtx*);
        int     (*getBuf)(struct gdIOCtx*, void*, int);

        void     (*putC)(struct gdIOCtx*, int);
        int     (*putBuf)(struct gdIOCtx*, const void*, int);

        int     (*seek)(struct gdIOCtx*, const int); /* Returns 1 on SUCCESS */
        long    (*tell)(struct gdIOCtx*); 

        void    (*free)(struct gdIOCtx*);

} gdIOCtx;
</PRE>

Most functions that accepted files in previous versions now also have a
counterpart that accepts an I/O context. These functions have a 'Ctx'
suffix.
<p>
The <xxx>Ctx routines use the function pointers in the I/O context pointed to
by gdIOCtx to perform all I/O. Examples of how to implement an I/O context
can be found in io_file.c (which provides a wrapper for file routines), and
io_dp.c (which implements in-memory storage).
<p>
It is not necessary to implement all functions in an I/O context if you know
that it will only be used in limited cirsumstances. At the time of writing
(Version 1.6.1, July 1999), the known requirements are:
<p>
<Table>
<TR><TD>All</TD><td width=20>&nbsp;</td><TD>Must have 'free',</td></tr>
<TR><TD>Anything that reads from the context</TD><td></td><TD>Must have 'getC' and 'getBuf',</td></tr>
<TR><TD>Anything that writes to the context</TD><td></td><TD>Must have 'putC' and 'putBuf'.</td></tr>
<TR><TD>If gdCreateFromGd2Part is called</td><td></td><TD>Must also have 'seek' and 'tell'. Note: seek must return 1 on SUCCESS and 0 on FAILURE.</td></tr>
<TR><TD>If gdImageGd2 is called</td><td></td><TD>Must also have 'seek' and 'tell'.</td></tr>
</Table>
