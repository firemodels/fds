This test simulates decaying isotropic turbulence in a periodic box.  There are FDS input files for two resolutions: 32^3 (dsmag_32.fds) and 64^3 (dsmag_64.fds).  In addition to the FDs input file, the test requires  the velocity field to be initialized.  The initial velocity field is read from the iso_ini*.dat file.  The run produces a devc output file for the integrated kinetic energy as a function of time.  It also generates [chid]_spec_000.dat, [chid]_spec_028.dat, and [chid]_spec_066.dat files which give the 3D energy spectrum in wavenumber space for comparison with the Comte-Bellot and Corrsin data (stored in cbcdata.txt).

Two Matlab scripts are provided in FDS-SMV/Utilities/Matlab/scripts for processing of the output data: energy_decay.m and plotspec.m

New random turbulence fields may be generated using the utility code turb_init.exe.  This code either (0) generates a new field based on a random seed or (1) reads the file ini_salsa.dat (generated by FDS if TURB_INIT=.TRUE.) and scales the energy in each wavenumber to match the spectrum in the file comte.interp2.dat (rename from either comte.interp2.32.rjm.dat or comte.interp2.64.rjm.dat depending on grid resolution).

Other dependencies: iso_ini.32.cbc.rjm.dat or iso_ini.64.cbc.rjm.dat
