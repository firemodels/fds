Fire Dynamics Simulator and Smokeview

*Continuous Integration. Continuous Improvement.*

Fire Dynamics Simulator ([FDS](https://github.com/firemodels/fds)) is a large-eddy simulation (LES) code for low-speed flows, with an emphasis on smoke and heat transport from fires.

Smokeview ([SMV](https://github.com/firemodels/smv)) is a visualization program used to display the output of FDS and [CFAST](https://github.com/firemodels/cfast) simulations.
