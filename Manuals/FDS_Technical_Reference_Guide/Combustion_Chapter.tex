\chapter{Combustion (Chemically Reacting Flows)}
\label{chapter:combustion}

\label{combustionsection}
The combustion model determines the mean chemical mass production rate of species $\alpha$ per unit volume, $\dot{m}^{\prime\prime\prime}_{\alpha}$, in the species transport equation, Eq.~(\ref{species}).  In general, $\dot{m}^{\prime\prime\prime}_{\alpha}$ requires a closure model because the flame thickness is on the order of one millimeter while the grid spacing is typically on the order of tens of centimeters.  This chapter describes a turbulent batch reactor model for $\dot{m}^{\prime\prime\prime}_{\alpha}$ capable of handling a range of mixing conditions and chemical kinetics.  In the non-premixed, fast chemistry limit, which is valid for the vast majority of FDS applications, the reactor model reduces to a simple ``mixed is burnt'' approximation called the Eddy Dissipation Concept (EDC) \cite{Magnussen:1,Poinsot:TNC}.

The combustion model also determines the heat release rate for per unit volume, $\dot{q}^{\prime\prime\prime}$, which is a quantity of fundamental importance in fire physics and typically the largest contribution to the velocity divergence, Eq.~(\ref{eqn_fdsD1}).  Once $\dot{m}^{\prime\prime\prime}_{\alpha}$ has been determined, the heat release rate follows by summing the mass production rates for each species times their respective heats of formation.  Details are discussed below in Section \ref{sec:hrr}.

Before discussing the combustion model, we first discuss of our \emph{lumped species} approach (Section \ref{sec:lumpedspecies}), which reduces the computational burden of the full chemical system by combining species into groups that transport and react together.  In other words, we reduce the number of transport equations we need to solve, which significantly increases the speed of the code.  Our basic mixing-controlled, fast chemistry combustion model is presented in Section \ref{sec:fastchemistry}, followed by details on computing the heat release rate and a simple model for thermal extinction. The model for the mixing time scale (needed in both EDC and the general reactor model) is discussed in Section \ref{sec:reac_time_scale}. In Section \ref{sec:batchreactormodel}, we begin the discussion of our generalized combustion model which is designed to handle both fast and slow chemistry and a range of mixing conditions.  For fire, this method holds promise for improved prediction of carbon monoxide and soot. Each computational cell is treated as a partially-stirred batch reactor with a characteristic mixing time.  Once reactants are mixed, the reaction rate depends on kinetics.  Section \ref{sec:reac_time_integration} discusses available kinetic mechanisms within FDS, from infinitely fast chemistry (default) to Arrhenius rate laws and reversible reactions.

\section{Lumped Species Approach}
\label{sec:lumpedspecies}

In the typical FDS problem the primitive species are lumped into reacting groups and we consider the simple reaction
\begin{equation}\label{eq:simple}
\mathrm{Fuel + Air \rightarrow Products}
\end{equation}
We refer to the Fuel, Air, and Products in Eq.~(\ref{eq:simple}) as \emph{lumped species}.  The lumped species approach is a simplified reaction progress variable approach~\cite{fox2003} in which all the progress variables are mass fractions. This avoids any complications related to boundedness and ill-defined initial and boundary conditions.

\subsection{Relationship between Lumped and Primitive Species}

In a simple hydrocarbon reaction, the reactants are the fuel, oxygen, and nitrogen and the products are carbon dioxide, water vapor, and nitrogen. The primitive species mass fractions are given by the composition vector
\begin{equation}\label{eq:prim_vector}
\mathbf{Y} = [Y_{\mathrm{CH}_4}\, \, Y_{\mathrm{O}_2}\, \, Y_{\mathrm{N}_2}\, \, Y_{\mathrm{CO}_2}\, \, Y_{\mathrm{H}_2\mathrm{O}}]^T
\end{equation}
Lumped species are groups of primitive species which only exist in the flow in certain proportions. For example, Air can be assumed to be a lumped species composed of 21~\% O$_2$, 79~\% N$_2$ by volume, plus trace amounts of water vapor and carbon dioxide. The key assumption made in lumping primitive species is that the new species groups transport (implying equal diffusivities) and react together.

In terms of primitive species, a one-step methane reaction may be written as
\begin{equation}\label{eq:lumped_methane}
\mbox{CH}_4 + 2\, \mbox{O}_2+7.52\,\mbox{N}_2 \rightarrow \mbox{CO}_2+2\,\mbox{H}_2\mbox{O}+7.52\,\mbox{N}_2
\end{equation}
This is equivalent to
\begin{equation}\label{eq:lumped_expand}
\mathrm{9.52\underbrace{(0.21\,\mbox{O}_2+.79\,\mbox{N}_2)}_\text{Air, $Z_0$}+\underbrace{\mbox{CH}_4}_\text{Fuel,~$Z_1$} \rightarrow 10.52\underbrace{(0.095\,\mbox{CO}_2+0.19\,\mbox{H}_2\mbox{O}+0.715\,\mbox{N}_2)}_\text{Products,~$Z_2$}}
\end{equation}
where 9.52~moles of Air react with 1~mole of Fuel to produce 10.52~moles of Products. Notice that the primitive species have been grouped by volume fraction into lumped species and the lumped species stoichiometric coefficients are the sum of the primitive species coefficients from Eq.~(\ref{eq:lumped_methane}). Note that 9.52 $\times$ 0.21 is only approximately equal to 2. In practice the atom balance requires machine precision. To alleviate this issue, FDS internally normalizes the lumped species volume fractions and makes any necessary adjustments to the specified lumped stoichiometric coefficients. The lumped species mass fractions are denoted $Z_i$, $i=0,1,...,N_Z$, where $N_Z$ is the number of tracked species.  The Background species, $Z_0$, is found from $Z_0=1-\sum_{i=1}^{N_{Z}} Z_i$. In the case of Eq.~(\ref{eq:lumped_expand}), two transport equations are solved (Fuel and Products).

The linear transformation from lumped species to primitive species is given by
\begin{equation}\label{eq:transform}
\textbf{Y}=A\textbf{Z}
\end{equation}
where $A$ is the transformation matrix ($N_{y}$ rows $\times$ $(N_{z}+1)$ columns).  Each column of $A$ represents a different lumped species.  The elements of $A$ are the mass fractions for each primitive species in a given lumped species:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:A_def}
a_{\alpha\,i} = \frac{\upsilon_{\alpha\,i}W_{\alpha}}{\displaystyle \sum_{\beta}\upsilon_{\beta i}W_{\beta}}
\end{equation}
where $\upsilon_{\alpha\,i}$ are the volume fractions of primitive species $\alpha$ in lumped species $i$ and $W_\alpha$ are the molecular weights. If we want the primitive species in Eq.~(\ref{eq:lumped_expand}) and, as an example, say we have $\mathbf{Z} = [0.3 \,\,\, 0.2 \,\,\, 0.5]^T$, we can transform from lumped species to primitive species via

\begin{equation}\label{eq:transform_to_primitive}
\mathbf{Y}=\left[\begin{array}{c}
       Y_{\mathrm{O}_2} \\
       Y_{\mathrm{N}_2} \\
       Y_{\mathrm{CH}_4} \\
       Y_{\mathrm{CO}_2} \\
       Y_{\mathrm{H}_2\mathrm{O}} \\
     \end{array}\right]
     =\left[\begin{array}{ccc}
     0.2330 & 0 & 0 \\
     0.7670 & 0 & 0.7248 \\
     0 & 1 & 0 \\
     0 & 0 & 0.1514 \\
     0 & 0 & 0.1238 \\
     \end{array}\right]
     \left[\begin{array}{c}
     0.3 \\
     0.2 \\
     0.5 \\
     \end{array}\right]
     =\left[\begin{array}{c}
     0.0699\\
     0.5925\\
     0.2000\\
     0.0757\\
     0.0619\\
     \end{array}\right]
\end{equation}
To transform back to lumped species from primitive species we can use:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:transform_back}
\textbf{Z}=B\textbf{Y} \quad ; \quad B=(A^TA)^{-1}A^T
\end{equation}
provided $A$ has full rank and $\mathbf{Y}$ is realizable (i.e., the forward transformation is also possible).

\subsection{Default Hydrocarbon Combustion Chemistry}
\label{sec:simplechemistry}

The default reaction equation in FDS, known as ``simple chemistry,'' is defined as follows:
\begin{multline}\label{eq:full_lump}
\nu_{0}\underbrace{(\upsilon_{\mathrm{O}_{2},0} \, \mathrm{O}_2 +\upsilon_{\mathrm{N}_{2},0} \, \mathrm{N}_2 + \upsilon_{\mathrm{H}_{2} \, \mathrm{O},0} \, \mathrm{H}_2 \, \mathrm{O}+\upsilon_{\mathrm{CO}_{2},0} \, \mathrm{CO}_2)}_\text{Background,~$Z_0$} \; + \; \nu_{1} \, \underbrace{\mbox{C}_m\mbox{H}_n\mbox{O}_a\mbox{N}_b}_\text{Fuel,~$Z_1$} \quad \longrightarrow \\
\nu_{2}\underbrace{(\upsilon_{\mathrm{CO}_{2},2} \, \mathrm{CO}_2 + \upsilon_{\mathrm{H}_{2} \, \mathrm{O},2} \, \mathrm{H}_2 \, \mathrm{O} + \upsilon_{\mathrm{N}_{2},2} \, \mathrm{N}_2+\upsilon_{\mathrm{CO},2} \, \mathrm{CO} + \upsilon_{\mathrm{S},2} \, \mathrm{Soot})}_\text{Products,~$Z_2$}
\end{multline}
Here, the volume fraction of primitive species $\alpha$ in lumped species $i$ is denoted by $\upsilon_{\alpha\,i}$ and the stoichiometric coefficients for the lumped species $i$ are denoted by $\nu_{i}$.

Carbon monoxide and soot yields are zero by default. The user can specify the CO and soot yields ($y_{\mathrm{CO}}$ and $y_{\mathrm{S}}$ respectively). The CO yield, and similarly for soot, is the mass of CO produced per mass of fuel reacted:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:y_co}
y_\mathrm{CO} = \frac{\mbox{mass CO in Products}}{\mbox{mass of Fuel reacted}}
\end{equation}
In this reaction system, Air (Background) is lumped species 0, Fuel is lumped species 1, and Products is lumped species 2. To find the stoichiometric coefficients of CO and soot within the products lumped species, FDS uses
\begin{align}\label{eq:yields}
\nu_{2}\upsilon_{\mathrm{CO},2}&=-\nu_{1}\frac{W_1}{W_{\mathrm{CO}}}y_{\mathrm{CO}} \\
\nu_{2}\upsilon_{\mathrm{S},2}&=-\nu_{1}\frac{W_1}{W_{\mathrm{S}}}y_{\mathrm{S}}
\end{align}
The remaining coefficients come from an atom balance.

\paragraph{Example} Consider a methane--air reaction where methane has a specified CO yield of $y_{\mathrm{CO}}=0.1$ and a Soot yield of $y_{\mathrm{S}}=0.01$. The default FDS reaction system lumps these species into Products. Note that, by default, Air is primarily composed of oxygen and nitrogen but includes trace amounts of carbon dioxide and water vapor. For this reaction the transformation matrix, $A$, is

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{c c c c }
                   & Air & Fuel & Products \\ \hline
{CH$_4$}           & 0.000000 & 1.000000 & 0.000000 \\
{N$_2$}            & 0.763017 & 0.000000 & 0.720373 \\
{O$_2$}            & 0.231163 & 0.000000 & 0.000000 \\
{CO$_2$}           & 0.000592 & 0.000000 & 0.143067 \\
{CO}               & 0.000000 & 0.000000 & 0.005589 \\
{H$_2$O}           & 0.005228 & 0.000000 & 0.130412 \\
{C}                & 0.000000 & 0.000000 & 0.000559 \\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\noindent The preceding table shows that the addition of carbon monoxide and soot increases the number of primitive species in the reaction from five to seven. The number of lumped species, however, remains at three---the composition of Products has changed to include to the two additional species.  Note that FDS prints the $A$ matrix in the {\ct CHID.out} file so that the user can double check the reaction system.

\section{Turbulent Combustion}

\subsection{Mixing-Controlled Fast Chemistry (Default)}
\label{sec:fastchemistry}

For the vast majority of FDS applications the ``mixed is burnt'' assumption is adequate to model the reaction system and the mean chemical source term for Fuel is modeled using the Eddy Dissipation Concept (EDC) of Magnussen and Hjertager~\cite{Magnussen:1,Poinsot:TNC}:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:edc}
\dot{m}_{\si{F}}^{\prime\prime\prime} = -\rho \frac{\min(Z_{\si{F}}, Z_{\si{A}}/s)}{\tau_{\rm mix}}
\end{equation}
Here, $Z_{\si{F}}$ and $Z_{\si{A}}$ are the lumped mass fractions of Fuel and Air, respectively, and $s$ is the mass stoichiometric coefficient for Air.  The quantity $\tau_{\rm mix}$ is a time scale for mixing which must be modeled (see Section \ref{sec:reac_time_scale}).  The EDC model therefore states that the rate of fuel consumption is proportional to both the local limiting reactant concentration and the local rate of mixing. As we will see below, the EDC model is a limiting case of a generalized partially-stirred batch reactor model in which all the reactants are initially unmixed and the rate of chemical kinetics is infinite.


\subsection{Heat Release Rate}
\label{sec:hrr}

The heat release per unit volume is found by summing the species mass production rates times the respective heats of formation:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:vol_heat_gen}
\dot{q}''' \equiv -\displaystyle \sum_{\alpha} \dot{m}_{\alpha}''' \, \Delta h_{{\rm f},\alpha}^0
\end{equation}


\subsection{Extinction}
\label{extinction}

Subgrid-scale modeling of gas phase suppression and extinction is still an area of active research in the combustion community. The physical mechanisms underlying these phenomena are complex, and even simplified models still rely on an accurate prediction of the flame temperature and local strain rate, neither of which is readily available in an LES calculation.

A limitation of the mixing-controlled reaction model described above is that it assumes fuel and oxygen always react regardless of the local conditions for temperature, dilution, or strain. For large-scale, well-ventilated fires, this approximation is usually sufficient. However, if a fire is in an under-ventilated compartment, or if a suppression agent like water mist or CO$_2$ is introduced, or if the strain between the fuel and oxidizing streams is high, burning may not occur.

FDS uses simple empirical rules---which ignore strain---to predict local extinction within a certain grid cell based on resolved species concentrations and the mean cell temperature.  The default FDS extinction model consists of two parts (shown below) based on the concept of a \emph{critical flame temperature} \cite{SFPE:Beyler}. If either criterion fails, then there is no chemical reaction and $\dot{m}_\alpha'''=0$ and $\dot{q}'''=0$ for that time step.

\paragraph{Basic Extinction Model}
\begin{enumerate}
\item If the cell temperature is below the auto-ignition temperature (AIT) for all fuels in the cell then combustion is suppressed. The auto-ignition temperature for each fuel is zero by default; thus, the user does not need to specify an ignition source.
\item If the potential combustion heat release from a \emph{local pocket of stoichiometric fuel-air-product (hereafter ``reactant'') mixture} cannot raise the temperature of that mixture above an empirically determined critical flame temperature, $T_{\rm CFT}$, then combustion is suppressed.  Consider the simple reaction $\mbox{Fuel} + \mbox{Air} \rightarrow \mbox{Products}$. The local mass fractions of lumped species Fuel, Air, and Products in the cell at the beginning of the combustion time step are $[Z_{\rm F}, Z_{\rm A}, Z_{\rm P}]$ and $s$ is the mass stoichiometric coefficient for Air (mass of Air required per mass of Fuel consumed). Based on the limiting reactant, the masses in the local reactant mixture are defined as follows (take 1 kg as a basis; the hat $\hat{\;}$ indicates a reactant mixture value):
\begin{align}
\label{eq:dzf} \hat{Z}_{\rm F} &= \min(Z_{\rm F},Z_{\rm A}/s) \\
\label{eq:dza} \hat{Z}_{\rm A} &= s \, \hat{Z}_{\rm F}
\end{align}
The stoichiometric mixture value for the product diluents is defined such that the following ratio holds:
\begin{align}
\label{eq:dzp} \frac{\hat{Z}_{\rm P}}{\hat{Z}_{\rm A}} &= \frac{\overbrace{Z_{\rm F} - \hat{Z}_{\rm F}}^{\mbox{\small unburned fuel}} + \;\; Z_{\rm P}}{Z_{\rm A}}
\end{align}
In other words, within the reactant mixture we lump unburned fuel in with any products or diluents and keep the ratio of diluent to air constant.

Another way to say this is that excess fuel acts as a diluent, but excess air does \emph{not}.  Hence, a large computational cell which is mostly air with a small amount of fuel (and no additional diluents) is likely to burn, whereas a cell which is mostly fuel with very little air will not burn.

Once the local reactant mixture has been determined, the extinction criterion is given by
\begin{align}
\label{eq:extinction}
\hat{Z}_{\rm F} \, (h_{\rm F}(T) + \Delta h_{\rm c,F}) + \hat{Z}_{\rm A} \, h_{\rm A}(T) + \hat{Z}_{\rm P} \, h_{\rm P}(T) <
\hat{Z}_{\rm F} \, h_{\rm F}(T_{\rm CFT}) + \hat{Z}_{\rm A} \, h_{\rm A}(T_{\rm CFT}) + \hat{Z}_{\rm P} \, h_{\rm P}(T_{\rm CFT})
\end{align}
where $T$ is the initial mean cell temperature and $T_{\rm CFT}$ is the critical flame temperature. If the inequality Eq.~(\ref{eq:extinction}) is true, then combustion is suppressed---the heat of combustion is not sufficient to raise the product mixture above its critical flame temperature.

\end{enumerate}

%The limiting flame temperature extinction algorithm is outlined below.
%
%\begin{enumerate}
%\item Search over all reactant species to find the limiting lumped species and express that species in terms of the reaction's fuel:
%\be
%\Delta \hat{Y}_{F} = - \min \left( \hat{Y}_F, \hat{Y}_{\alpha} \,\frac{\nu_{F}\,W_{F}}{\nu_{\alpha}\,W_{\alpha}}\right) \quad ; \quad \mbox{for all reactants, $\alpha$}
%\ee
%If fuel is the limiting reactant then $\Delta \hat{Y}_{F}$ is the local fuel mass fraction. If the oxidizer is the limiting reactant then $\Delta \hat{Y}_{F}$ is the mass fraction of fuel in stoichiometric proportion to oxidizer mass fraction.
%\item Store $\Delta \hat{Y}_{F}$, remove that amount of fuel from the local gas, and renormalize the mass fractions to account for the removal of fuel.
%\item Search over all the updated non-fuel reactant species in the gas to determine the limiting reactant.  This defines how much air is required to burn the fuel:
%
%\be \Delta \hat{Y}_{air} = \min \left(\frac{\Delta \hat{Y}_{F} W_{\alpha} \nu_{\alpha}}{Z_{\alpha} W_F} \right); \quad \mbox{for all non fuel reactants, $\alpha$, in reaction $n$} \ee
%Note: $\Delta \hat{Y}_{air}$ is in stoichiometric proportion to $\Delta \hat{Y}_{F}$.
%\item Compute the enthalpy for the fuel and the air at both the current temperature and the limiting flame temperature (LFT).
%\item Combustion is allowed if
%
%\be \Delta \hat{Y}_{air} h_{air}(T)+\Delta \hat{Y}_{F} \left( h_F(T)+\Delta h_{c,F} \right) > \Delta \hat{Y}_{air} h_{air}(T_{LFT})+ \Delta \hat{Y}_{F} h_F(T_{LFT}) \ee
%\item If combustion is not allowed, $\Delta \hat{Y}_{F}$ is set to 0.
%\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Alternative Extinction Model}

In addition to the extinction model described above, there is the option to select a simpler extinction model based on the limiting oxygen concentration. Details of this model are discussed in Appendix \ref{o2_based_model}.


\subsection{Reaction Time Scale Model}
\label{sec:reac_time_scale}

In this section we provide an expression for the mixing time based on the local state of the flow field.  The basic idea behind the model we propose here is to consider the three physical processes of diffusion, subgrid-scale (SGS) advection, and buoyant acceleration and to take the fastest of these processes (locally) as the controlling flow time scale~\cite{McDermott:2011}.

It is important to consider the behavior of an SGS model as the LES filter width (cell size) varies. The mixing times for diffusion, SGS advection, and buoyant acceleration scale differently with filter width and if we look to the limits of the filter scales an interesting picture emerges.  Referring to Fig.~\ref{fig_reaction_time_scale}, let us move from left to right along the horizontal axis following the thick black line which represents our time scale model for a hypothetical flow condition.  First, notice that the reaction time scale must be greater than or equal to the chemical time scale, $\tau_{\rm chem}$, which, though usually small, is finite. At a slightly larger scale, we expect the mixing time to vary as the square of the filter width because the mixing is controlled by molecular diffusion.  In this regime, denoted $\tau_{\rm d}$, the numerical solution is a DNS and this scaling law is valid while $\Delta$ is less than the Kolmogorov scale, $\eta$, the length scale of the smallest turbulent eddies (for this discussion we assume the Schmidt number (Sc) is of order unity). For a sufficiently high Reynolds number flow (such that an inertial subrange exists), as the filter width increases beyond the Kolmogorov scale we encounter a regime, marked $\tau_{\rm u}$, where turbulent advection controls the rate of mixing and the mixing time varies as the two-thirds power of the filter width \cite{Pope:2000}.  This is the regime where most LES submodels are valid (It is important to appreciate that fire differs from turbulent combustion in that the assumption of locally high Re is frequently invalid).

Now, let us imagine what should happen to the mixing time as the filter width increases beyond the inertial subrange to a length scale larger than the height of the flame itself (actually a possibility in wildfire modeling). We would \emph{not} expect the inertial range scaling to continue up through the so-called ``energy-containing'' range of turbulent length scales.  Rather, for fires we expect buoyant acceleration to control the mixing at these relatively coarse scales.  A time scale based on a constant acceleration goes as the square root of the filter width, as shown by the regime marked $\tau_{\rm g}$ in the diagram.  This shift in scaling may appear minor given the log-log nature of the plot, but the effect of the acceleration-based time scale is indeed significant for large cell sizes.  Finally, note that the flame height presents a limit to the reaction time scale, here denoted $\tau_{\rm flame}$, since all fuel must be consumed within a single cell.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=4.5in]{FIGURES/reaction_time_scale}
\vskip-.2cm
\caption{Reaction time scale model.}
\label{fig_reaction_time_scale}
\end{figure}

Of course, the relative importance of the physical processes will depend on the flow.  For example, if gravity is weak, the $\tau_{\rm g}$ line shifts up and may not affect the reaction time before the flame time scale is reached.  If the flow is highly turbulent, the inertial range scaling may be more dominant, which would be indicated by a lowering of the $\tau_{\rm u}$ line.  Or, for highly turbulent jet flames $\tau_{\rm flame}$ may be reached before the acceleration time scale has any effect.  Perhaps more typical for low strain fires, if an inertial subrange does not exist (if the Reynolds number is too low relative to the Froude number), then the $\tau_{\rm u}$ line in Fig.~\ref{fig_reaction_time_scale} moves up out of the picture and we are left with diffusion and buoyancy to control the mixing.

The bold solid line in Fig.~\ref{fig_reaction_time_scale} is mathematically represented by
\begin{equation}
\label{eqn_tau_mix}
\tau_{\rm mix} = \max(\tau_{\rm chem},\min(\tau_{\rm d},\tau_{\rm u},\tau_{\rm g},\tau_{\rm flame}))
\end{equation}
The mathematical details of the submodels are as follows:
\begin{align}
\label{eq:tau_diff} \tau_{\rm d} &= \frac{\Delta^2}{D_{\si{F}}} \\
\label{eq:tau_sgs}  \tau_{\rm u} &= \frac{C_u \,\Delta}{\sqrt{(2/3)k_{\rm sgs}}} \\
\label{eqn_tau_grav}\tau_{\rm g} &= \sqrt{ 2\Delta/g }
\end{align}
where $D_{\si{F}}$ is the diffusivity of the fuel species. Note that $k_{\rm sgs}$ is the unclosed subgrid kinetic energy per unit mass which by default is taken from the model for the turbulent viscosity (see Section \ref{section:turbulent_viscosity}).  The advective time scale constant is calibrated to match the Heskestad flame height correlation \cite{FDS_Validation_Guide} and is set to $C_u = 0.4$. The acceleration time scale $\tau_{\rm g}$ is the time required to travel a distance $\Delta$ starting from rest under a constant acceleration, $g=\SI{9.81}{m/s^2}$.


\subsection{Turbulent Batch Reactor Model}
\label{sec:batchreactormodel}

Modeling chemical reactions in turbulent flow is mathematically challenging because the length and time scales associated with the reactions may be orders of magnitude below what can be spatially and temporally resolved by the simulation.  When the fuel and oxidizer are initially unmixed (diffusion flame) and the kinetics are fast compared with mixing, the simple Eddy Dissipation Concept (EDC) model \cite{Magnussen:1,Poinsot:TNC} is sufficient.  However, for more complex reactions---such as carbon monoxide and soot formation---where reaction and mixing time scales may overlap, we require a more generalized approach.

To this end, we have developed a simple mixing environment method to close the mean chemical source term, $\dot{m}^{\prime\prime\prime}_{\alpha}$, in Eq.~(\ref{species}).  For pure diffusion flames our method is similar to EDC, but the method is not limited to diffusion flames.  Each computational cell is thought of as a turbulent batch reactor (TBR). At the start of a time step, each cell has an initial concentration of species (reactants, products, inerts) that exist with some degree of mixing. By default, each cell is completely unmixed at the start of a time step (corresponding to a diffusion flame). Generally, the rate of mixing is dominated by turbulence. The mixing time, $\tau_{\rm mix}$, was discussed in Section \ref{sec:reac_time_scale}. Once mixed, species can react based on specified kinetic parameters---reactions may be infinitely fast or governed by an Arrhenius rate law (Section \ref{Reaction_Rate_Model}).

At the start of the integration of the reactor model, the species transport equations have been solved and we know the mean cell concentrations of all reactants in our chemical system.  In this section, for simplicity we will work in terms of primitive species mass fractions.

\subsection{A Simple Subgrid Mixing Environment}
\label{sec:subgrid_evironment}

The cell mean mass fraction of $\alpha$, a function of time, is denoted $\widetilde{Y}_\alpha(t)$. The local concentration at any point within the cell exists in one of two states: completely unmixed or completely mixed.  Let $\hat{Y}_\alpha(t)$ denote the mass fraction of $\alpha$ in the mixed reactor zone, initially equal to the cell mean, $\hat{Y}_\alpha(0) = \widetilde{Y}_{\alpha}^0 \equiv \widetilde{Y}_{\alpha}(0)$.  With $\psi_\alpha \in [0,1]$ representing the sample space for the composition, the subgrid probability density function (PDF) may be written as
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:pdf}
f(\psi_\alpha;t) = w_1 \delta(0-\psi_\alpha) + w_2 \delta(1-\psi_\alpha) + w_3 \delta(\hat{Y}_\alpha[t] - \psi_\alpha)
\end{equation}
where $\delta(x)$ is the Dirac delta function.  In other words, if we look at a specific point, the mass fraction of species $\alpha$ may only be 0, 1, or equal to the mixed zone value, $\hat{Y}_\alpha$ (see Fig.~\ref{fig_subgrid_environment}).  The weights $w_i$ must satisfy integral constraints on the cell: $\int f(\psi_\alpha;t) \d \psi_\alpha = 1$, $\int f(\psi_\alpha;t) \psi_\alpha \d \psi_\alpha = \widetilde{Y}_\alpha(t)$.

For convenience, we define the \emph{unmixed fraction}, $\zeta(t)$, as the fraction of mass within the cell existing as either 0 or 1.  To satisfy the integral constraints, the PDF weights are set to
\begin{align}
w_1 &= \zeta \, (1 - \widetilde{Y}_\alpha^0) \\
w_2 &= \zeta \, \widetilde{Y}_\alpha^0 \\
w_3 &= 1-\zeta
\end{align}
As shown in Appendix~\ref{app:unmixed_fraction}, the unmixed fraction evolves by the following simple ODE
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:zeta}
\frac{\d \zeta}{\d t}=-\frac{\zeta}{\tau_{\rm mix}}
\end{equation}
with the solution
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:zeta_soln}
\zeta(t) = \zeta_0 \,{\rm e}^{-t/\tau_{\rm mix}}
\end{equation}
The initial condition $\zeta_0$ may be specified, modeled algebraically, or taken from the update of a passive scalar transport equation.  Currently, FDS takes $\zeta_0=1$ as default for LES mode (diffusion flame) and $\zeta_0=0$ as default for DNS (it is assumed that the mixing time scale is well-resolved).


\subsection{Mean Chemical Source Term}
\label{source_term}

At any point in time, the composition of the computational cell may be determined by combining the unmixed and mixed portions:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:final_comp}
\widetilde{Y}_{\alpha}(t)= \zeta(t) \, \widetilde{Y}_{\alpha}^0 + (1-\zeta(t)) \, \hat{Y}_{\alpha}(t)
\end{equation}
Differentiating (\ref{eq:final_comp}) in time and using (\ref{eq:zeta}) we see that our model for the chemical source term needed in (\ref{species}) is given by
\begin{equation}
\label{mass_prod_rate}
\dot{m}^{\prime\prime\prime}_{\alpha} = \rho \frac{\mbox{d}\widetilde{Y}_{\alpha}}{\mbox{d}t}
= \rho \left[ \frac{\zeta}{\tau_{\rm{mix}}} (\hat{Y}_\alpha - \widetilde{Y}_{\alpha}^0)  + (1-\zeta) \frac{\mbox{d}\hat{Y}_\alpha}{\mbox{d}t} \right]
\end{equation}
Note that the unmixed fraction is comparable to the \emph{complement} of the fraction of ``reacting fine structures'' in other EDC formulations \cite{Chen:1,Panjwani:2010}, but in our model this fraction evolves in time.  A comparison between our model and that of Panjwani et al.~\cite{Panjwani:2010} is developed further in Appendix~\ref{app:eddy_dissipation_concept}.

An alternate derivation of (\ref{eq:final_comp}) and (\ref{mass_prod_rate}) in terms of moments of the transport equation for the PDF (\ref{eq:pdf}) is given in Appendix~\ref{app:pdf_transport}.  This derivation highlights that the implicit mixing model is a \emph{variant of} the `interaction by exchange with the mean' or IEM model \cite{Dopazo:1974}, which we refer to as the `interaction by exchange with the mixed mean' or IEMM.

\subsection{Evolution of the Composition in the Mixed Reactor Zone}

Since (\ref{mass_prod_rate}) was obtained by differentiating (\ref{eq:final_comp}) and we are ultimately interested in integrating over an LES times step $\Delta t$ to obtain the final cell composition, it turns out to be easier and more accurate to simply work in terms of (\ref{eq:final_comp}). Thus, the problem is reduced to finding a solution for $\hat{Y}_{\alpha}(t)$, since the solution $\zeta(t)$ is known from (\ref{eq:zeta_soln}).

The composition in the mixed reactor zone changes by two processes: mixing (mass is transferred from the unmixed zone to the mixed zone) and chemical reaction. As a consequence of the time splitting scheme, the total mass within the reactor (computational cell) is constant over a time step.  We denote this mass by $\rho V_{\rm c}$, where $\rho$ is the initial cell mass density and $V_{\rm c}$ is the cell volume.  The unmixed mass is denoted $U(t)$ and the mixed mass is denoted $M(t)$.  Given (\ref{eq:zeta_soln}), the following equations describe the cell mass evolution:
\begin{align}
\label{eq:mixunmix_1} \rho V_{\rm c} &= U(t) + M(t) \\
\label{eq:mixunmix_2} U(t) &= \zeta(t)\,\rho V_{\rm c} \\
\label{eq:mixunmix_3} M(t) &= (1-\zeta(t))\,\rho V_{\rm c}
\end{align}

Within the mixed reactor zone, let $m_\alpha(t)$ denote the mass of species $\alpha$.  The mass fraction of $\alpha$ in the mixed zone may then be written as
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:mass_fraction_mixed}
\hat{Y}_{\alpha}(t)\equiv\frac{m_{\alpha}(t)}{M(t)}
\end{equation}
This concentration is important because Arrhenius rate laws are based on the mixed composition only.

The ODE governing the mixed species mass is
\begin{align}
\label{eq:mixmass}
\frac{\d m_{\alpha}}{\d t} &= \hat{Y}_\alpha \frac{\d M}{\d t} + M \frac{\d \hat{Y}_\alpha}{\d t} \notag\\
&= - \widetilde{Y}_{\alpha}^0 \frac{\d U}{\d t} + M \frac{\d \hat{Y}_\alpha}{\d t} \notag\\
&= \rho V_{\rm c} \left[ \frac{\zeta \, \widetilde{Y}_{\alpha}^0 }{\tau_{\rm mix}} + (1-\zeta) \frac{\d \hat{Y}_\alpha}{\d t} \right]
\end{align}
The first term  on the RHS accounts for mixing.  The second term represents chemical kinetics. Note that in the second step we have utilized the fact that the unmixed composition remains constant (at the initial cell mean) throughout the time step. The third step follows from (\ref{eq:zeta}), (\ref{eq:mixunmix_2}), and (\ref{eq:mixunmix_3}).

\subsection{Time Integration for Mixing and Reaction}
\label{sec:reac_time_integration}

In this section, we discuss the numerical solution of (\ref{eq:mixmass}). Let $\Delta t^k$ represent the $k$th sub-time step in the integration (less than or equal to the LES time step $\delta t$); $t^k=0$ at the start of the reactor integration.  The integration is time split such that \emph{mixing is done first, followed by reaction}. A simple explicit update of (\ref{eq:mixmass}) over the sub-time interval $t^k$ to $t^k + \Delta t^k$ is given by
\begin{align}
\label{eq:dmdt_1} m_\alpha^* &= m_{\alpha}(t^k) - [ \zeta(t^k+\Delta t^k) - \zeta(t^k) ] \, \widetilde{Y}_{\alpha}^0 \, \rho V_{\rm c} \\
\label{eq:ystar}  \hat{Y}_\alpha^* &= m_\alpha^*/M^* \\
\label{eq:dmdt_2} \hat{Y}_\alpha(t^k + \Delta t^k) &= \hat{Y}_\alpha^* + \Delta \hat{Y}_\alpha^*
\end{align}
The superscript $^*$ indicates a post-mixing value.  The first step, (\ref{eq:dmdt_1}), is an analytical solution for the mixing step (first term in (\ref{eq:mixmass})), obtained using (\ref{eq:zeta_soln}).  The mixing time scale $\tau_{\rm mix}$, needed in (\ref{eq:zeta_soln}), is computed once per LES time step using (\ref{eqn_tau_mix}) and held constant during the reactor integration. The mixed mass, $M^* = M(t^k + \Delta t^k)$, is evaluated at the end of the subinterval using (\ref{eq:mixunmix_3}). For fast chemistry, we take only one sub-step ($\Delta t^{k=1} = \delta t$).

The method to determine $\Delta \hat{Y}_\alpha^*$ (the change in mass fraction of $\alpha$ due to chemical reaction) in (\ref{eq:dmdt_2}) depends on the complexity of the reaction system.  Below we first discuss the simplest case of infinitely fast chemistry.  Then we discuss finite-rate chemistry.

At the end of the time integration, the mixed zone composition, $\hat{Y}_\alpha(\delta t)$, is combined with the unmixed mass in (\ref{eq:final_comp}) to obtain the final cell composition.

%\subsection{Time Integration of Chemical Reactions}
%\label{sec:reac_time_integration}
%
%In this section, we discuss the numerical solution of Eq.~(\ref{eq:mixmass}).  The solution $m_\alpha(t)$ is then used together with $M(t)$ in Eq.~(\ref{eq:mass_fraction_mixed}) to determine the evolution of the mass fraction in the mixed zone of the reactor, $\hat{Y}_\alpha(t)$.
%
%Let $\Delta t^k$ represent the $k$th sub-time step in the integration (not necessarily equal to the FDS time step $\delta t$); $t^k=0$ at the start of the reactor integration.  The integration is time split such that \emph{mixing is done first, followed by reaction}. A simple explicit update of Eq.~(\ref{eq:mixmass}) over the sub-time interval $t^k$ to $t^k + \Delta t^k$ is given by
%\begin{align}
%\label{eq:dmdt_1} m_\alpha^* &= m_{\alpha}(t^k) + [ \zeta(t^k) - \zeta(t^k+\Delta t^k) ] \, \rho V \, \overline{Y}_{\alpha,0}  \\
%\label{eq:dmdt_2} m_\alpha(t^k + \Delta t^k) &= m_{\alpha}^* + M(t^k + \Delta t^k) \, \Delta \hat{Y}_\alpha^*
%\end{align}
%The superscript $^*$ indicates the post-mixing, pre-reaction value.  The first step, Eq.~(\ref{eq:dmdt_1}), is an analytical solution for the mixing step (second term in Eq.~(\ref{eq:mixmass})) over the subinterval, obtained using Eqs.~(\ref{eq:mixingstep}), (\ref{eq:mixunmix_2}), and (\ref{eq:zeta_soln}).  The unmixed fractions $\zeta(t^k)$ and $\zeta(t^k + \Delta t^k)$ are obtained from Eq.~(\ref{eq:zeta_soln}). The mixing time scale $\tau_{\rm mix}$ needed in Eq.~(\ref{eq:zeta_soln}) is computed once per FDS time step and held constant during the reactor integration. The mixed mass, $M(t^k + \Delta t^k)$, is evaluated at the end of the subinterval using Eq.~(\ref{eq:mixunmix_3}). For a single step, mixing-controlled reaction, we take only one sub-step and $\Delta t = \delta t$.  This is discussed in more detail below.
%
%The method to determine $\Delta \hat{Y}_\alpha^*$ (the change in mass fraction of $\alpha$ due to chemical reaction) in Eq.~(\ref{eq:dmdt_2}) depends on the complexity of the reaction system.  Below we first discuss the simplest (default) case of a single step, mixing-controlled (infinitely fast) reaction.  Then we discuss multiple fast reactions.  And finally, finite-rate chemistry.
%
%Once the mixed zone mass has been updated, the mixed zone mass fractions are computed by
%\begin{equation}
%\label{eq:mixed_mass_fraction_sub}
%\hat{Y}_\alpha(t^k + \Delta t^k) = \frac{m_\alpha(t^k + \Delta t^k)}{M(t^k + \Delta t^k)}
%\end{equation}
%At the end of the time integration, the mixed zone composition, $\hat{Y}_\alpha(\delta t)$, is combined with the unmixed mass in Eq.~(\ref{eq:final_comp}) to obtain the final cell composition.

\subsection{Infinitely Fast Chemistry (Default)}

%In practice, for fast chemistry $E$ and $n$ in Eq.~(\ref{eq:finite_rate_fin}) are set to zero, which removes the temperature dependence from the rate expression. The species exponents, $a_{\alpha}$, in Eqs.~(\ref{eq:aprime}) and (\ref{eq:finite_rate_fin}) are also set to zero to remove concentration dependence. Finally, the pre-exponential factor, $A^{\prime}$, is set to $1 \times 10^{16}$. As a result, $\mbox{d}\hat{Y}_{\rm F}/\mbox{d}t$ becomes sufficiently large such that the fuel in the mixed zone can be stoichiometrically consumed in a single time step, effectively making the rate infinite.

\subsubsection{Single Reaction}
For a single reaction, the change in fuel is based on the limiting reactant \cite{Poinsot:TNC}:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:stoich_fuel_single}
\Delta \hat{Y}_{\rm F} = -\min \left( \hat{Y}_{\rm F}, \hat{Y}_{\alpha} \,\frac{\nu_{\rm F}\,W_{\rm F}}{\nu_{\alpha}\,W_{\alpha}}\right) \quad ; \quad \mbox{for all reactants, $\alpha$}
\end{equation}
The minimum is taken in Eq.~(\ref{eq:stoich_fuel_single}) to ensure that the reactant species mass fractions remain realizable.

\subsubsection{Multiple Reactions}
For multiple reactions with infinitely fast chemistry, the reaction rate is treated as a second-order (assuming two reactants) Arrhenius reaction with zero activation energy.  The Arrhenius constant is set to a large value.  Further discussion of the time integration for these cases is given in Appendix \ref{chemistry_integration}.

\subsection{Finite-Rate Chemistry (Arrhenius Reaction)}
\label{Reaction_Rate_Model}

Consider a simple one-step forward reaction:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:generic_1step}
a\mathrm{A} + b\mathrm{B} \rightarrow c\mathrm{C} + d\mathrm{D}
\end{equation}
The rate expression for species A with a mixed zone concentration of $C_{\mbox{\scriptsize A}}$ in \si{mol/cm^3} and rate constant $k$ is
\begin{equation}\label{eq:generic_rate}
\frac{\d C_{\mbox{\scriptsize A}}}{\d t}= -k\; C_{\mbox{\scriptsize A}}^{\,a}\; C_{\mbox{\scriptsize B}}^{\,b}
\end{equation}
Consider a set of $N_r$ reactions with fuel F. The reaction rate (\si{mol/(cm^3.s)}) for F in the $i$th reaction is
\begin{equation}\label{eq:rate_f}
r_{\si{F},i}= -k_{i}\; \prod C_{\alpha}^{\,a_{\alpha,i}}
\end{equation}
For the $i$th Arrhenius reaction, the rate constant, $k_i$, depends on the temperature, $T$, the temperature exponent, $n_i$, the pre-exponential factor, $A_i$, and the activation energy, $E_i$:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:rate_cons}
k_i = A_i\;T^{n_i}\;\mathrm{e}^{-E_{a,i}/RT}
\end{equation}
Note that the units of $E_a$ are J/mol and units of $A$ are ((\si{mol/cm^3})$^{1-\sum a_{\alpha}}$)/s.  Note that $\sum a_{\alpha}$ is the \emph{order} of the reaction.  The units of $A$ take the appropriate form to ensure the units of Eq.~(\ref{eq:rate_f}) are \si{mol/(cm^3.s)}.

The reaction rate for species $\alpha$ of the $i$th reaction is based on the ratio of stoichiometric coefficients:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:rate_a}
r_{\alpha,i}= \left(\frac{\nu_{\alpha,i}}{\nu_{F,i}}\right)\,r_{\si{F},i}
\end{equation}
The change in concentration for species $\alpha$ within the mixed reactor zone is then:
\begin{equation}\label{rate_expression}
\frac{\d C_{\alpha}}{\d t} = \sum_{i} r_{\alpha,i}
\end{equation}
FDS only transports lumped species and only lumped species can be consumed or created.  Note, however, that any of the primitive species may participate in a reaction rate law.

It is more convenient for FDS to work in terms of mass fractions, $Y_{\alpha}$.  The concentrations (\si{mol/cm^3}) and mass fractions (kg $\alpha$/kg) are related by $C_{\alpha}=Y_{\alpha} \rho/(W_{\alpha} \times 1000)$, where the density, $\rho$, has units of \si{kg/m^3}.
To simplify the calculations within FDS, density and molecular weight are pulled out of the product concentrations on the right hand side of Eq.~(\ref{eq:rate_f}) and combined with the other constants to form $A^{\prime}$:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:aprime}
A^{\prime}_{i} = A_{i} \, \prod \, (W_{\alpha} \times 1000)^{\,-a_{\alpha,i}} \times \left(\frac{1 \; \si{kmol}}{10^3 \; \si{mol}}\right) \times \left(\frac{10^6 \; \si{cm^3}}{1 \; \si{m^3}}\right) \times W_{\,\si{F}}
\end{equation}
Using $A_i^{\prime}$, the reaction rate in mass units becomes
\begin{equation}\label{eq:finite_rate_fin}
r^{\prime}_{\si{F},i} = -A_i^{\prime}\;\rho^{\sum a_{\alpha,i}}\;T^{n_i}\;\mathrm{e}^{-E_i/RT}\;\prod Y_{\alpha}^{\,a_{\alpha,i}} \quad [=] \quad \left(\frac{\si{kg \; F}}{\si{m^3.s}}\right)
\end{equation}
The mass rate of reaction per unit volume for species $\alpha$ in the $i$th reaction is
\begin{equation}\label{eq:rate_a_y}
r^{\prime}_{\alpha,i}= \left(\frac{\nu_{\alpha,i}\,W_{\alpha}}{\nu_{\si{F},i}\,W_{\,\si{F}}}\right)\,r^{\prime}_{\si{F},i} \quad [=] \quad \left(\frac{\si{kg \; \alpha}}{\si{m^3.s}}\right)
\end{equation}
Last, the rate of change in composition for species $\alpha$ in the mixed reactor zone becomes
\begin{equation}\label{rate_expression_y}
\frac{\d \hat{Y}_{\alpha}}{\d t} = \frac{1}{\rho}\sum_{i} r^{\prime}_{\alpha,i} \quad [=] \quad \left(\frac{\si{kg \; \alpha}}{\si{kg.s}}\right)
\end{equation}
See Appendix~\ref{chemistry_integration} for a discussion on the algorithm used to ensure species remain bounded.

\subsubsection{Third Body Reactions}

At low pressures, it is common to see so-called \emph{third body} reactions.  These reactions require the presence of some other molecule, M, for heat dissipation \cite{Turns:1996}.  The reaction scheme is usually written as
\begin{equation}\label{eq:third_body}
\mathrm{A} + \mathrm{B} + \mathrm{M} \rightarrow \mathrm{C} + \mathrm{M}
\end{equation}
The Arrhenius rate law has a first-order dependence on the concentration of M.  Since M may be \emph{any} other molecule, we take $C_{\si{M}} = \bar{p}/(R T) = \rho/(\overline{W} \times 1000) \;[=]\;\si{mol/cm^3}$.

\subsubsection{Time Integration for Finite-Rate Chemistry}

For reactions other than single step, mixing controlled chemistry, a fourth-order explicit integrator with error control is used. The time integration follows the procedure outlined in Eqs.~(\ref{eq:dmdt_1}) and (\ref{eq:dmdt_2}), but multiple subiterations are generally needed and the change in composition over the subinterval in the mixed reactor zone, $\Delta \hat{Y}_\alpha^*$, is usually obtained by integrating an Arrhenius rate law (we say ``usually'' because a combination of fast and finite-rate chemistry is permissible). More detail on the numerical methods of the integrator, including a method to combat stiff chemistry, can be found in Appendix~\ref{chemistry_integration}.

\subsection{Change in Species Compositions}

Using the change in fuel concentration for each of the $i$ reactions, the change in each species $\alpha$ is given by
\begin{equation}\label{eq:change_alpha}
\Delta \hat{Y}_{\alpha} = \sum_i \,\left(\frac{\nu_{\alpha,i} \,W_{\alpha}}{\nu_{{\rm F},i} \,W_{{\rm F},i}}\right)\Delta \hat{Y}_{{\rm F},i}
\end{equation}
