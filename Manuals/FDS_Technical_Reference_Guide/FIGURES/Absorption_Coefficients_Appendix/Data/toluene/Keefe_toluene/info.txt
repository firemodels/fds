Appl. Spec., 48, 127 (1994). 

The files are in Galactic’s spc format and some are available in .y format (ASCII file with starting wavenumber, ending wavenumber, number of data points, y values).

In the file names the following notation is used.

dc - real dielectric constant
dl - imaginary dielectric constant (dielectric loss)
em - molar absorption coefficient (in 105 cm2 mol-1 or in L mol-1 cm-1)
ip - imaginary molar polarizability (in cm3 /mol)
k - imaginary refractive index (absorption index)
n - real refractive index
ram - Raman spectrum
