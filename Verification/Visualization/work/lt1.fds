&HEAD CHID='lt1',TITLE='light test' /

 simple test case to generate smoke to test lighting algorithm in smokezip
 soot yield is increased to exagerate smoke optical thickness
 NFRAMES is set to a small value to shorten smokezip calculation time (for testing)

 lighting input parameters are set in lt1.lit
