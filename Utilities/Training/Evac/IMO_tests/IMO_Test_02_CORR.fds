       an evacuation calculation is done (no fire meshes at all).

 Note: suppress fire related output, because just evacuation
       meshes present. DT_PART is used both by fire and
       evacuation meshes. For evacuation it is the time step
       how often the positions of the agents are saved on the
       disk for Smokeview. The DT_HRR is also the output time step
       for the CHID_evac.csv spreadsheet file. The output time step
       will not be shorter than the EVAC_DT_STEADY_STATE (default is
       0.05 s) on the TIME-namelist.

 Default material for evacuation meshes is INERT and its color
 can not be changed esily in Smokeview.  Thus, an evacuation
 material is defined below, which has only color.  Of course,
 one can give explicitely COLOR or RGB on the OBST lines also.

 DoorL1 ==> Corr1 ==> DoorR1, but this is just a simple
 test case for stairs, so there are no VENTs for doors,
 i.e., the main evacuation flow field is used (which is
 from left to right) everywhere.

 Next fills the corridor space away from the evacuation mesh.
 This is needed, because this is just a simple test case geometry,
 and just one mesh is used.

 Distribution type 0: a single value, MEAN is used
 Distribution type 1: uniform distribution, LOW and HIGH are used
 Color method 0: Agents are colored using EVAC line colors
 Color method 3: Agents are colored using PERS line colors

 Agents start to walk at t=1.0 s. Target speed is 1.0 m/s.
 t_det is the detection time and t_pre is the reaction time
 and (t_pre + t_det) is the time when agents start to move
 towards the exit doors.
