    <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>
        <b>Fire Dynamics Simulator (FDS)</b> is a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model of fire-driven fluid flow.
        The software solves numerically a form of the Navier-Stokes equations appropriate for low-speed, thermally-driven flow, with an emphasis on smoke and heat transport from fires.
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>Smokeview (SMV)</b> is an OpenGL visualization program that is used to display the output of FDS and <a href="http://fast.nist.gov/" target="_blank">CFAST</a> simulations.
        <br />
        <br />
        The Fire Dynamics Simulator and Smokeview applications are developed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) of the United States Department of Commerce, in cooperation with VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland.
