Solid phase heat conduction and reaction calculation of a 0.9 cm thick 
slab of plastic pyrolyzing under a heat flux of 50 kW/m2. 
The calculation is purely for the solid phase. There is no gas phase 
coupling -- just a fixed external heat flux of 50 kW/m2.

WARNING: The material properties contained in this file are for 
demonstration purposes only!  They may or may not be
