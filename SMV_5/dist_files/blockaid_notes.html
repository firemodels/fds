<h2>Blockaid - Release Notes</h2>
<p>$Date$<br>
$Revision$<br>

<p>Blockaid reads in an FDS input file and outputs a new one where specified
  groups of blockages, holes and vents are replicated, translated and/or rotated.
  These groups are surrounded with <tt>&BGRP</tt> and <tt>&EGRP</tt> keywords as in:<br />
  <p><tt>
      &BGRP GRP_ID='group label' ORIG=x,y,z /<br />
 </tt>
        <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp one or more &OBST, &VENT, &HOLE or &GRP lines<br />
<tt>          
      <p>&EGRP /<br />
 </tt>
  <p>where ORIG is the point about which rotation occurs.  Note that the <tt>&BGRP &EGRP</tt> 
  pair may contain references to other groups.
  <p>A group may be replicated using:
    <p><tt> &GRP GRP_ID='group label' XYZ=x,y,z ROTATE=angle /</tt>
  <p>where x,y,z is the translation amount and angle is snapped to the 
  nearest 90 degrees.
  
  <p>A collection of groups may be defined and stored in a file.  This file
  is referenced using the <tt>&INCL</tt> keyword as in
  <tt>&INCL FILE='file name' /</tt>
  
  <h2>Examples</h2>
  <h3>Arranging Furniture</h3>
A group of blockages defining a couch:
<pre>
&BGRP GRP_ID='COUCH' ORIG=3.0,3.0,0.0 /
&OBST   XB= 3.0, 5.0, 3.5, 3.7, 0.5, 0.9  ,   RGB=128, 64, 32 /
&OBST   XB= 3.0, 3.2, 3.0, 3.5, 0.5, 0.6  ,   RGB= 64, 96, 64 /
&OBST   XB= 4.8, 5.0, 3.0, 3.5, 0.5, 0.6  ,   RGB= 32,128, 96 /
&OBST   XB= 3.0, 5.0, 3.0, 3.7, 0.0, 0.5  ,   RGB=  0,196,128 /
&HOLE   XB=-0.4, 4.8, 3.2, 3.5, 0.0, 0.4  /
&HOLE   XB= 3.1, 4.9, 3.5, 3.7, 0.0, 0.1  /
&EGRP /
</pre>
 <img src="blockaid1.png" width=320 align="right"/>
<p>A group of three couches defining a living room arrangement:
<pre>
&BGRP GRP_ID='LIVE1' ORIG=0.0,0.0,0.0 /
&GRP GRP_ID='COUCH' XYZ=0.0,  0.0,0.0 ROTATE=180.0 /
&GRP GRP_ID='COUCH' XYZ=2.0,  0.8,0.0 ROTATE=270.0 /
&GRP GRP_ID='COUCH' XYZ=0.0,  3.0,0.0 ROTATE=0.0 /
&EGRP /
</pre>

<p>The <tt>&OBST</tt> and <tt>&HOLE</tt> keywords used by FDS to define 
couches in 4 living room arrangements
are expanded by Blockaid using:
<pre>
&GRP GRP_ID='LIVE1' XYZ=0.0,0.0,0.0 ROTATE=0.0 /
&GRP GRP_ID='LIVE1' XYZ=4.0,0.0,0.0 ROTATE=90.0 /
&GRP GRP_ID='LIVE1' XYZ=4.0,4.3,0.0 ROTATE=180.0 /
&GRP GRP_ID='LIVE1' XYZ=0.0,4.3,0.0 ROTATE=270.0 /
</pre>
<h3>Stairs</h3>
<p>Group of blockages to define a set of stairs for one half of a building story:</p>
<pre>
&BGRP GRP_ID='STAIRS' ORIG=0.0,0.0,0.0 /
&OBST   XB= 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.4, 0.0, 0.2  ,   COLOR='RED' /  stairwell
&OBST   XB= 0.0, 1.0, 0.3, 0.7, 0.2, 0.4  ,   RGB=100,50,25/  stairwell

&OBST   XB= 0.9, 1.1, 0.0, 4.3, 0.0, 2.8  ,   COLOR='MAGENTA' /  stairwell
&OBST   XB= 0.0, 1.0, 3.9, 4.3, 2.6, 2.8  ,   COLOR='GREEN' /  stairwell

</pre>

<img src="story3.png" width=320 align="right"/>
<p>Combine two sets of <em>half</em> stairs to form a full set of stairs:
<pre>
&BGRP GRP_ID='BISTAIRS' ORIG=0.0,0.0,0.0 /

3 floors are expanded by Blockaid using:
