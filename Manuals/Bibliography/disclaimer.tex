\chapter{Disclaimer}

The US Department of Commerce makes no warranty, expressed or implied,
to users of the Fire Dynamics Simulator (FDS), and accepts no responsibility for its use.
Users of FDS assume sole responsibility under Federal law for determining
the appropriateness of its use in any particular application;
for any conclusions drawn from the results of its use; and for any
actions taken or not taken as a result of analysis performed using these tools.

Users are warned that FDS is intended for use only by those competent
in the fields of fluid dynamics, thermodynamics, heat transfer, combustion, and fire science,
and is intended only to supplement the informed judgment of the qualified user.
The software package is a computer model that may or may not have predictive
capability when applied to a specific set of factual circumstances.
Lack of accurate predictions by the model could lead to erroneous
conclusions with regard to fire safety. All results should be evaluated by an informed user.

Throughout this document, the mention of computer hardware or commercial
software does not constitute endorsement by NIST, nor does it indicate that
