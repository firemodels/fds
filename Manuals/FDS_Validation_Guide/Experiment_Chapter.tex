\chapter{Description of Experiments}

\label{Experiments_Chapter}

This chapter contains a brief description of the experiments that were used for model validation. Only enough detail is included here to provide a
general understanding of the model simulations. Anyone wishing to use the experimental measurements for validation ought to consult the cited test reports
or other publications for a comprehensive description.


\section{ArupFire Tunnel Fire Experiments}

Gabriele Vigne and Jimmy J\"{o}nsson of ArupFire conducted a series of fire experiments within a tunnel with a 50~m$^2$ cross section. The tunnel is located
in La Ribera del Folgoso, Spain. It is approximately 6.5~m high, 8~m wide and 300~m long.
Five replicate tests were conducted using a 1~m by 2~m steel pan filled with heptane on water. Near-ceiling temperatures
were measured 2~m, 4~m, 6~m and 8~m from the plume centerline. The peak heat release rate was approximately 5.3~MW.


\section{ATF Corridors Experiments}

A series of eighteen experiments were conducted in a two-story structure with long hallways and a connecting stairway
in the large burn room of the ATF Fire Research Laboratory in Ammendale, Maryland, in 2008~\cite{Sheppard:Corridors}.
The test enclosure consisted of two 17.0~m long hallways connected by a
stairway consisting of two staircases and an intermediary landing.
There was a door at the opposite end of the first floor hallway, which was closed during all tests.
The end of the second floor hallway was open with a soffit near the ceiling.

The walls and ceilings of the test structure were constructed of 1.2~cm gypsum wallboard.
The flooring throughout the structure, including the stairwell landing floor, consisted of one layer of 1.3~cm thick cement board on one
layer of 1.9~cm thick plywood supported by wood joists. The first set of stairs, which had eight risers, led from the first floor up to the landing area.
The second set of stairs, which had nine risers, led from the landing area up to the second floor.
The stairs were constructed of 2.5~cm thick clear pine lumber. The two set of stairs were separated by an approximately 0.42~m wide gap in the middle of the stairwell.
This gap was separated from the stairs by a 0.91~m tall barrier constructed of a single piece of gypsum board.
The flue space was open to the first floor.  The flue space was separated from the second floor by a 0.9~m tall barrier constructed of gypsum board.
There was a metal exterior type door at the end of the first floor near the burner.  The door was closed during all experiments.

The fire source was a natural gas diffusion burner.  The burner surface was horizontal, square and 0.45~m on each side, its surface was 0.37~m above the floor, and it was filled with gravel.
The burner was located near the end of the first floor away from the stairs. A diagram of the test structure is displayed in Figure~\ref{ATF Drawing}.

\section{Beyler Hood Experiments}

Craig Beyler performed a large number of experiments involving a variety of fuels, fire sizes, burner diameters, and
burner distances beneath a hood~\cite{Beyler:Hood}.  The hood consisted of concentric cylinders separated
by an air gap.  The inner cylinder was shorter than the outer and this allowed combustion products to be removed
uniformly from the hood perimeter.  The exhaust gases were then analyzed to determine species concentrations.
The burner could be raised and lowered with respect to the bottom edge of the hood.  Based on the published
measurement uncertainties, species errors are estimated at 6~\%.  148 tests were performed with measurements made in the
exhaust duct.  The fuels in those tests were as follows: 16 acetone, 11 ethanol, 13 isopropanol, 18 methanol, 51 propane, 28 propylene, and 11 toluene.
Hood equivalence ratios varied from 0.2 to 1.7.  A subset of 47 tests spanning the equivalence ratio range for each fuel was simulated for
validation (5, 5, 5, 5, 15, 7, and 5 respectively for the fuels mentioned above).



\section{BRE Spray Test for Radiation Attenuation}

Murrel et al.~\cite{Murrel:1995} measured the attenuation of thermal radiation passing through a water
spray using a heat flux gauge. The radiation was produced by a heat panel, one meter square, at 900~$^\circ$C. The horizontal distance
from the radiation panel to the spray nozzle was 2 m and to the measurement point 4 m. The nozzles were positioned at
a height 0.24 m above the panel upper edge. The heat flux gauge was positioned at the line passing through the center
of the panel. The attenuation of radiation was defined as $(q_0-q_s)/q_0$, where $q_0$ is the initial radiative heat flux,
measured without a spray, and $q_s$ is the heat flux measured during the spray operation.

Experimental results are used from three full-cone type nozzles, labeled A, B and D. The opening angles of the nozzles were between 90 and 108 degrees.
The purpose of the simulation is to compare the measured and simulated attenuation of radiation at different flow conditions. The nozzles were
specified in terms of median droplet size and mean vertical velocity using PDPA measurement in a single position, 0.7 m below the nozzle. The droplet
boundary conditions were determined by assuming $d_m \propto p^{-1/3}$ and $v \propto p^{1/2}$ type of dependences between the droplet size, speed
and pressure.

\section{Bryant Doorway Velocity Measurements}

Rodney Bryant of the Fire Research Division at NIST performed a series of velocity measurements of the gas
velocity within the doorway of a standard ISO~9705 compartment for fires ranging from
34~kW to 511~kW~\cite{Bryant:FSJ2009,Bryant:EF2009,Bryant:CS2010}. A doorway
served as the only vent for the enclosure. It included a jamb of 30~cm extending outward
to facilitate the laser measurements. The entire compartment was elevated 0.3~m off the floor of the laboratory.

The measurements were made using both bi-directional probes and PIV (Particle Image Velocimetry). The PIV measurements only cover the
lower two-thirds of the doorway because of difficulties in seeding the hot outflow gases. The bi-directional probe measurements span the
entire height of the doorway, but Bryant reports that
these measurements were up to 20~\% greater than the PIV measurements in certain regions of
the flow. Consequently, only the PIV data was used for comparison to the
model.


\section{Cable Response to Live Fire -- CAROLFIRE}

CAROLFIRE was a project sponsored by the U.S.~Nuclear Regulatory Commission to study the thermal response and functional behavior of electrical cables~\cite{CAROLFIRE}. The primary objective of CAROLFIRE was to characterize the various modes of electrical failure (e.g., hot shorts, shorts to ground) within bundles of power, control and instrument cables. A secondary objective of the project was to develop a simple model to predict \underline{th}ermally-\underline{i}nduced \underline{e}lectrical \underline{f}ailure (THIEF). The measurements used for these purposes were conducted at Sandia National Laboratories and are described in Volume II of the CAROLFIRE test report. In brief, there were two series of experiments. The first were conducted within a heated cylindrical enclosure. Single and bundled cables were exposed to various heat fluxes and the electrical failure modes recorded. The second series of experiments involved cables within trays in a semi-enclosed space under which a gas-fueled burner created a hot layer to force cable failure. Only results from the first series are used here.

Petra Andersson and Patrick Van Hees of the Swedish National Testing and Research Institute (SP) proposed that a cable's thermally-induced electrical failure can be predicted via a one-dimensional heat transfer calculation, under the assumption that the cable can be treated as a homogenous cylinder~\cite{Andersson:2005}. Their results for PVC cables were encouraging and suggested that the simplification of the analysis is reasonable and that it should extend to other types of cables. The assumptions underlying the THIEF model are as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
\item The heat penetration into a cable of circular cross section is primarily in the radial direction.
\item The cable is homogenous in composition. In reality, a cable is constructed of several different types of polymeric materials, cellulosic fillers, and a conducting metal, most often copper.
\item The thermal conductivity, specific heat, and density of the assumed homogenous cable are independent of temperature. In reality, both the thermal conductivity and specific heat of polymers are temperature-dependent, but this information is not easily obtained from manufacturers.
\item It is assumed that no decomposition reactions occur within the cable during its heating, and ignition and burning are not considered in the model. In fact, thermoplastic cables melt, thermosets form a char layer, and both release volatile gases up to and beyond the point of electrical failure.
\item Electrical failure occurs when the temperature just inside the cable jacket reaches an experimentally determined value.
\end{enumerate}




\section{Cup Burner Experiments}

The cup-burner is a widely used experimental apparatus for studying the effectiveness of flame extinguishing agents. The test is designed to determine the effectiveness of various extinguishing agents. Typically, these experiments feature a steady fuel-air coflow diffusion flame that is established above the cup. The extinguishing agent is gradually introduced into the air stream to determine the minimum concentration of the agent that leads to lift off. Two experimental data sets are examined: methane (CH$_4$) - air coflow~\cite{Takahashi:2007} and n-heptane (C$_7$H$_{16}$) - air coflow~\cite{Moore:1996}. The extinguishing agents of interest are argon (Ar), carbon dioxide (CO$_2$), helium (He), and nitrogen (N$_2$).

\section{FAA Cargo Compartments}

The U.S.~Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has sponsored experiments and modeling of smoke transport within aircraft storage compartments~\cite{FAA-AR-03-49,FAA-AR-07-27}. Two types of compartments were used; one from a Boeing~707 and one from a McDonnell Douglas DC-10. The 707 compartment was 6.7~m in length, 3.2~m in width, and 1.4~m in height. The DC-10 compartment was 14~m in length, 4.4~m in width, and 1.7~m in height. The fire for all experiments was fueled by a 0.1~m by 0.1~m tray of plastic resin producing a peak HRR of 5~kW~\cite{FAA-AR-06-21}. The long walls of the compartments were barrel-shaped to conform to the shape of the aircraft fuselage. The fire was placed in different locations, and measurements of gas and ceiling temperature, heat flux, gas concentration, and smoke obscuration were made at a variety of locations, mostly near the ceiling.


\section{FAA Polymers}

As part of their efforts to characterize the burning behavior of commonly used plastics, the U.S.~Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) conducted measurements of the thermal properties of
charring and non-charring polymers with the specific purpose of providing input data for numerical pyrolysis models~\cite{Stoliarov:CF2009,Stoliarov:CF2010}.
The study aimed to determine whether a one-dimensional conduction/reaction model could be used
as a practical tool for prediction and/or extrapolation of the results of fire calorimetry tests. The non-charring polymers included poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA),
high-impact polystyrene (HIPS), and high density
polyethylene (HDPE). The charring polymers included polycarbonate (PC) and polyvinyl chloride (PVC).


\section{Fleury Heat Flux Measurements}

Rob Fleury, a masters degree student at the University of Canterbury in Christchurch, New Zealand, measured the heat flux from a variety of propane fires~\cite{Fleury:Masters}.
The objective of the work was to evaluate a variety of empirical heat flux calculation methods. For the measurements, heat flux gauges were mounted on moveable dollies that
were placed in front of, and to the side of, burners with dimensions of 0.3~m by 0.3~m (1:1 burner), 0.6~m by 0.3~m (2:1 burner), and 0.9~m by 0.3~m (3:1 burner). The heat release
rates were set to 100~kW, 150~kW, 200~kW, 250~kW, and 300~kW. The gauges were mounted at heights of 0~m, 0.5~m, 1.0~m, and 1.5~m relative to the top edge of the burner.

\section{FM Parallel Panel Experiments}

Patricia Beaulieu of Worcester Polytechnic Institute made heat flux measurements within a set of vertical parallel panels as part of a cooperative research program between Worcester Polytechnic Institute and FM Global (Factory Mutual)~\cite{Beaulieu:FM}. The experimental apparatus consisted of two vertical parallel panels, 2.4~m high and 0.6~m wide, with a sand burner at the base. The objective of the project was to measure the flame spread rate over various composite wall lining materials, but there were also experiments conducted with inert walls for the purpose of measuring the heat flux from fires fueled by propane and propylene at heat release rates of 30~kW, 60~kW, and 100~kW.



\section{FM/SNL Test Series}


The Factory Mutual and Sandia National Laboratories (FM/SNL) test series consists of 25 compartment fire experiments conducted in 1985 for the U.S.~Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) by Factory Mutual Research Corporation (FMRC), under the direction of Sandia National Laboratories (SNL)~\cite{Nowlen:NUREG4681,Nowlen:NUREG4527}. The primary purpose of these experiments was to provide data with which to validate computer models for various types of compartments typical of nuclear power plants. The experiments were conducted in an enclosure measuring approximately 18~m long by 12~m wide by 6~m high, constructed at the FMRC fire test facility in Rhode Island. A drawing is included in Figure~\ref{FM_SNL_Drawing}. All of the experiments included forced ventilation to simulate typical power plant conditions. Six of the experiments were conducted with a full-scale control room mock-up in place. Parameters varied during the experiments included fire intensity, enclosure ventilation rate, and fire location. This guide uses data from nineteen experiments (Tests 1-17, 21, and 22). In these experiments, the fires were fueled by a propylene gas burner, and heptane and methanol liquid pools. In the experiments not selected, the heat release was not reported and could not be estimated with confidence. Table~\ref{FM_SNL_Matrix} lists the test parameters.

The following information was provided by the test director, Steve Nowlen of Sandia National Laboratory. In particular, Tests 4, 5, and 21 were given extra attention.
\begin{description}
\item[Heat Release Rate:] The HRR was determined using oxygen consumption calorimetry in the exhaust stack with a correction applied for the carbon dioxide in the upper layer of the compartment. The uncertainty of the fuel mass flow was not documented. Several tests selected for this study had the same target peak heat release rate of 516~kW following a 4~min ``t-squared'' growth profile. The test report contains time histories of the measured HRR, for which the average, sustained HRR following the ramp up for Tests 4, 5, and 21 have been estimated as 510~kW, 480~kW, and 470~kW, respectively. Once reached, the peak HRR was maintained essentially constant during a steady-burn period of 6~min in Tests~4 and 5, and 16~min in Test~21. Note that in Test 21, Nowlen reports a ``significant'' loss of effluent from the exhaust hood that could lead to an under-estimate of the HRR towards the end of the experiment.
\item[Radiative Fraction:] The radiative fraction was not measured during the experiment, but in this study it is assumed to equal 0.35, which is typical for a smoky hydrocarbons. It was further assumed that the radiative fraction was about the same in Test~21 as the other tests, as fuel burning must have occurred outside of the electrical cabinet in which the burner was placed.
\item[Measurements:] Four types of measurements were conducted during the FM/SNL test series that are used in the current model evaluation study, including the HGL temperature and depth, and the ceiling jet and plume temperatures. Aspirated thermocouples (TCs) were used to make all of the temperature measurements. Generally, aspirated TC measurements are preferable to bare-bead TC measurements, as systematic radiative exchange measurement error is reduced.
\item[HGL Depth and Temperature:] Data from all of the vertical TC trees were used when reducing the HGL height and temperature. For the majority of the tests, Sectors 1, 2, and 3 were used, all weighted evenly. For Tests 21 and 22, Sectors 1 and 3 were used, evenly weighted. Sector 2 was partially within the fire plume.

%\section{FPRF/HAI Corridor Test Series}
%
%The Fire Protection Research Foundation sponsored a series of tests to evalaute the performance of smoke detection mounted in a corridor with deep beam pockets.  The test apparatus consisted of a 14.63 m (48 ft) x 3.66 m (12 ft) movable ceiling to which walls and beams could be attached.  The ceiling was instrumented with gas thermocouples along the centerline,  both at the ceiling and on the bottoms of beams, gas thermocouples along the wall and optical density meters.  21 combinations of beam depth (none, 0.3 m and 0.6 m), corridor width (1.52 m and 3.66 m), and ceiling height (2.74 m, 3.66 m, and 5.49 m) were tested.  Each ceiling height was also tested without walls to serve as an unconfined, smooth ceiling test.  Each test used an 0.3 m (1 ft) x 0.3 m, square sand burner that was centered in the corridor.  Fires were 100 kW propylene fires with a soot yield of 4.8 \% (the soot yield was measured during the test series).  A summary of the tests is shown in Table~\ref{FPRF_HAI_Matrix}.

\section{Hamins Methane Burner Experiments}

Anthony Hamins et al. performed a series of experiments with circular gas burners measuring the radial and vertical radiative heat flux profiles outside the flame region. The experiments are described in Ref.~\cite{Hostikka:3}. Experiments performed with three burner diameters, 0.10 m, 0.38 m and 1.0 m, are used for validation.


\section{Harrison Spill Plumes}

Roger Harrison, a student at the University of Canterbury, New Zealand, performed a series of one-tenth scale experiments to characterize thermal spill plume
entrainment~\cite{Harrison:2009,Harrison:IAFSS2008,Harrison:FT2007,Harrison:FSJ2010}. The dimensions of the fire compartment were 1~m by 1~m by 0.5~m high.
The height of the compartment opening was equal to the height of the compartment. The width of the opening was varied from 0.2~m to 1~m.
A 0.3~m balcony was attached to the top of the compartment opening. The balcony extended 0.5~m beyond each side of the fire compartment.
The heat release rate of the fire varied from 5~kW to 15~kW.
The plume entrainment rate was measured at different heights by varying the exhaust rate of gases from a hood above the compartment.
Two different test configurations were used to model both detached and adhered spill plumes. A diagram of the test structure is displayed in Figure~\ref{Harrison_Drawing}.

\section{Heskestad Flame Height Correlation}

A widely used experimental correlation for flame height is given by the expression~\cite{Heskestad:FSJ1983,SFPE:Heskestad}:
\be
   \frac{L_{\rm f}}{D} = 3.7 \; (\dot{Q}^*)^{2/5} - 1.02  \quad ; \quad \dot{Q}^* = \frac{\dQ}{\rho_\infty \, c_p \, T_\infty \, \sqrt{g} \; D^{5/2} }
\ee
where $\rho_\infty$, $c_p$, and $T_\infty$ are the ambient density, specific heat, and temperature. $\dot{Q}^*$ is a non-dimensional quantity that relates the fire's heat release rate, $\dQ$, with the diameter of its base, $D$. The greater the value of $Q^*$, the higher the flame height relative to its base diameter.


\section{LEMTA Spray Test for Radiation Attenuation}

Lechene et al.~\cite{Lechene} measured the attenuation of thermal radiation passing through a water
spray using a heat flux gauge. The radiation was produced by a 30~cm by 35~cm heat panel whose emission is close
to a black body at 500~$^\circ$C. The horizontal distance
from the radiation panel to the spray nozzle was 1.5~m and to the measurement point 3~m. The heat flux gauge was positioned at the line passing through the center of the panel.
Water mist is produced by seven nozzles arranged in a row, 10~cm apart. They are positioned 1.5~m high. The heat panel is translated vertically during the experiment,
the distance between the panel upper edge and the nozzle row varying between 20~cm and 100~cm.

The attenuation of radiation is defined as previously described for the BRE Spray experiments.
The purpose of the simulations is to compare the measured and simulated attenuation of radiation at different heights.
The water mist nozzle has been characterized by Lechene by measuring the spray
angles and the water flow rate. The droplet size is set by using a PDPA measurement in a single position, 20~cm below the injection point.


\section{LLNL Enclosure Experiments}

Sixty-four tests were conducted by Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) in 1986 to study the effects of ventilation on enclosure fires~\cite{Foote:LLNL1986}. The test enclosure was 6~m long, 4~m wide, and 4.5~m high (Fig.~\ref{LLNL_Enclosure_Drawing}). It contained a methane rock burner which was placed in the center of the space. For most of the tests the burner was placed on the floor. The fires varied in size from 50~kW to 400~kW. The burner was 0.57~m in diameter and 0.23~m height. The door was closed and sealed for most tests, and air was pulled through the space at rates varying from 100~g/s to 500~g/s. In some tests the enclosure included a plenum space, where make-up air could be injected from above or below. The test matrix is listed in Table~\ref{LLNL_Matrix}.

\section{McCaffrey Plume Experiments}

In 1979, at the National Bureau of Standards (now NIST), Bernard McCaffrey measured centerline temperature and velocity profiles above a porous, refractory burner.
There were five distinct heat release rates, ranging from 14~kW to 57~kW. The fuel was natural gas. The burner was square, 0.3~m on each side.
The results of the experiments are reported in Reference~\cite{McCaffrey:NBSIR_79-1910}.


\section{NBS Multi-Room Test Series}

The National Bureau of Standards (NBS, which is now called the National Institute of Standards
and Technology, NIST) Multi-Room Test Series consisted of 45 fire tests representing
9 different sets of conditions were conducted in a three-room suite (see Fig.~\ref{NBS_Drawing}). The experiments were
conducted in 1985 and are described in detail in Ref.~\cite{Peacock:NBS_Multi-Room}. The suite consisted of two relatively
small rooms, connected via a relatively long corridor. The fire source, a gas burner, was located
against the rear wall of one of the small compartments.
Fire tests of 100~kW, 300~kW and 500~kW were conducted. For the current study, only three 100~kW fire experiments have been used,
including Test~100A from Set~1, Test~100O from Set~2, and Test~100Z from Set~4. These tests
were selected because they had been used in prior validation studies, and because these tests had the
steadiest values of measured heat release rate during the steady-burn period.

Following is additional information provided by the test director, Richard Peacock of NIST:
\begin{description}
\item[Heat Release Rate:] In the two tests for which
the door was open, the HRR during the steady-burn period measured via oxygen consumption
calorimetry was 110~kW with an uncertainty of about 15~\%, consistent with the replicate
measurements made during the experimental series and the uncertainty typical of oxygen
consumption calorimetry. It was assumed that the closed door test (Test~100O) had the same HRR as the open
door tests.
\item[Radiative Fraction:] Natural gas was used as the fuel in
Test~100A. In Tests~100O and 100Z, acetylene was added to the natural gas to increase the
smoke yield, and as a consequence, the radiative fraction increased. The radiative fraction of
natural gas has been studied previously, whereas the radiative fraction of the acetylene/natural
gas mixture has not been studied. The radiative fraction for the natural gas fire was assigned a
value of 0.20, whereas a value of 0.30 was assigned for the natural gas/acetylene fires.
\item[Measurements:] Only two types of measurements conducted during the NBS test series were used in the
evaluation considered here, because there was less confidence in the other measurements.
The measurements considered here were the HGL temperature and depth, in which bare bead
TCs were used to make these measurements. Single point measurements of temperature within
the burn room were not used in the evaluation of plume or ceiling jet algorithms. This is because
the geometry was not consistent in either case with the assumptions used in the model algorithms
of plumes or jets. Specifically, the burner was mounted against a wall, and the room width-to-height
ratio was less than that assumed by the various ceiling jet correlations.

\section{NIST Helium Experiments}

Eighteen experiments were conducted at NIST in which helium was released over a lengthy time period inside of a 1.5~m by 1.5~m by 0.75~m plexiglass box with one or two small leakage holes~\cite{Pitts:2011}. The experiments were intended to represent the release of hydrogen from passenger vehicle fuel cell inside of a residential garage. Test parameters included the release rate and length, the location of the release, and the size and location of the leakage. Measurements were made of the helium concentration in a rake at seven locations over the height of the compartment during the release and for a period of up to 11 hours post-release.

Test variables included all permutations of the leak rate and time (14.8~L/min over 3600~s or 3.71~L/min over 14400~s), leak location (on the floor at the center of the compartment, on the floor at the center of the rear wall, and 2.5~cm below the ceiling at the center of the compartment), and the leak area (2.4~cm by 2.4~cm at the center of the front wall, 3.05~cm by 3.05~cm at the center of the front wall, and a pair of 2.15~cm by 2.15~cm centered on the front wall 2.5~cm from the floor and ceiling).

Leakage areas were square holes under 10~cm$^2$ in area.  Attempting to resolve flows through these holes would have required very small grid cells in the vicinity of the holes.  Instead, the FDS HVAC model was used.  For each leakage hole a pair of HVAC ducts was defined over a height of two grid cells (one grid cell height for each vent).  Each duct was assigned one-half the leakage area and the experimentally determined orifice flow coefficient. This approach enabled bi-directional flow to occur at the leakage vent as occurred during each test following the termination of the helium release.



\section{NIST/NRC Test Series}

These experiments, sponsored by the US NRC and conducted at NIST, consisted of 15 large-scale experiments performed in June 2003. All 15 tests were included in the validation study. The experiments are documented in Ref.~\cite{Hamins:SP1013-1}. The fire sizes ranged from 350 kW to 2.2 MW in a compartment with dimensions 21.7~m by 7.1~m by 3.8~m high, designed to represent a compartment in a nuclear power plant containing power and control cables. A diagram of the test structure is displayed in Figure~\ref{NIST_NRC_Drawing}.

\end{sidewaysfigure}

The walls and ceiling were covered with two layers of marinate boards, each layer 0.0125~m thick. The floor
was covered with one layer of gypsum board on top of a layer of plywood. Thermo-physical and optical properties of the marinate
and other materials used in the compartment are given in Ref.~\cite{Hamins:SP1013-1}. The room had one door and a mechanical air injection and extraction
system. Ventilation conditions, the fire size, and fire location were varied. Numerous measurements (approximately 350 per test) were made including
gas and surface temperatures, heat fluxes and gas velocities.

Following are some notes provided by Anthony Hamins, who conducted the experiments:
\begin{description}
\item[Natural Ventilation:] The compartment had a 2~m by 2~m door in the middle of the west wall. Some of the tests had a closed door and no mechanical
ventilation (Tests 2, 7, 8, 13, and 17), and in those tests the measured compartment leakage was an important consideration. The test report lists leakage
areas based on measurements performed prior to Tests 1, 2, 7, 8, and 13. For the closed door tests, the leakage area used in the simulations was
based on the last available measurement. The chronological order of the tests differed from the numerical order.
For Test 4, the leakage area measured before Test 2 was used. For Tests 10 and 16, the leakage area
measured before Test 7 was used.
\item[Mechanical Ventilation:] The mechanical ventilation and exhaust was used during Tests 4, 5, 10, and 16, providing about 5 air changes per hour. The
door was closed during Test 4 and open during Tests 5, 10, and 16. The supply duct was positioned on the south wall, about 2~m off the floor. An
exhaust duct of equal area to the supply duct was positioned on the opposite wall at a comparable location. The flow rates through the supply and
exhaust ducts were measured in detail during breaks in the testing, in the absence of a fire. During the tests, the flows were monitored with single
bi-directional probes during the tests themselves.
\item[Heat Release Rate:] A single nozzle was used to spray liquid hydrocarbon fuels onto a 1~m by 2~m fire pan that was about 0.1~m deep. The test plan
originally called for the use of two nozzles to provide the fuel spray. Experimental observation suggested that the fire was less unsteady with the
use of a single nozzle. In addition, it was observed that the actual extent of the liquid pool was well-approximated by a 1~m circle in the
center of the pan. For safety reasons, the fuel flow was terminated when the lower-layer oxygen concentration
dropped to approximately 15~\% by volume.
The fuel used in 14 of the tests was heptane, while toluene was used for one test. The HRR was
determined using oxygen consumption calorimetry. The recommended uncertainty values
were 17~\% for all of the tests.
\item[Radiative Fraction:]  The values of radiative fraction and its uncertainty were reported as
\num{0.44 \pm 0.07} and \num{0.40 \pm 0.09} for heptane and toluene, respectively.
\item[Soot Yield:]  The values of the soot yield and its uncertainty were reported as \SI{0.0149 \pm 0.0033}{kg/kg}
and \SI{0.195 \pm 0.052}{kg/kg} for heptane and toluene, respectively.

\section{NIST Full Scale Enclosure Experiments}

The NIST Full Scale Enclosure Experiments were conducted in an ISO-9705 compartment~\cite{Lock:1}. The experiments were designed to study the effects of fuel type, fuel distribution, and vent size on under-ventilated compartment fires. Over 20 experiments were conducted, which included 7 different fuels, 3 fuel sources, and 4 ventilation openings. Table~\ref{tab:NIST_FSE_Exp} provides a summary of the experiments. Species concentrations and temperature measurements were made at the front and rear of the compartment.

\section{NIST Reduced Scale Enclosure Experiments}

The NIST Reduced Scale Enclosure (RSE) is a 40~\% scale version of the ISO~9705 compartment~\cite{Bryner:1}. It measures 0.98 m wide by 1.46 m deep by 0.98 m tall.  The compartment contains a door centered on the smaller wall that measures 0.48~m wide by 0.81 m tall.  A 15~cm diameter natural gas burner was positioned in the center of the compartment.  The burner was on a stand so that its top was 15~cm above the floor. The fires ranged from 50~kW to 600~kW. Species measurements, including CO concentration, were made near the ceiling in the front and back of the compartment.

\section{NIST Smoke Alarm Experiments}

A series of experiments was conducted by NIST to measure the activation time of ionization and photoelectric
smoke alarms in a residential setting~\cite{Bukowski:1}. Tests were conducted in actual homes with
representative sizes and floor plans, utilized actual furnishings and household items for fire sources,
and tested actual smoke alarms sold in retail stores at that time. Thirty-six tests were conducted in two
homes; 27 in a single-story manufactured home, and 8 in a two-story home.
Eight experiments that were conducted in the single-story manufactured home were selected for model validation.
Only tests that used a flaming ignition source with a couch or mattress fuel package were considered;
the cooking oil fires and tests that used a smoldering ignition source were not considered.
The flaming ignition tests used a moderate flame source to quickly ignite the fuel package.
Note that Test SDC15 was excluded due to a failed ignition event.

The primary partitioning of the single-story floor plan consisted
of three bedrooms, one full bathroom, one kitchen/dining area, one living room, and two hallways.
For testing, the doors to bedroom 3 and the bathroom were always closed. The ceiling was peaked
on the long axis, reaching a height of 2.4~m. The outside walls were approximately 2.1~m in height.
The slope of the ceiling was approximately 8.4$^\circ$. Groups of smoke alarms were located in the
room of fire origin, at least one bedroom, and in a central location. Five stations (Station A
through Station E) containing smoke alarm arrays were mounted parallel to the ceiling. Note that,
in the FDS Guides, smoke detectors and smoke alarms are collectively referred to as smoke detectors
because the same smoke detection algorithm is used to predict activation of either type of device.

Although a load cell was used in the experiments to measure the mass loss rate of the fuel package, the mass loss data
were not reliable enough to reconstruct the HRR curves for each test. Instead, the HRR curves were determined by approximating
the fire growth using a $t$-squared ramp, as in Eq.~(\ref{eq:t_squared}). The parameters for the $t$-squared ramp were calibrated in FDS
by using the temperature measured at the highest thermocouple in the tree (2~cm below the ceiling) in the fire room.
\be
\dot Q = \dot Q_0 \left( \frac{t}{\tau} \right)^2
\label{eq:t_squared}
\ee
A time offset was used to align the predicted ceiling thermocouple temperatures with the measured temperatures.
This offset is reported as the time at which the $t$-squared ramp begins.
The t-squared calibration parameters and time offsets for the HRR ramps are shown in Table~\ref{tab:NIST_Smoke_Alarms_Summary}.
Additionally, the ignition source had a small effect on the measured ceiling thermocouple temperatures. Therefore,
the size of the ignition source was approximated as either 3~kW or 7~kW, and the time offset of the ignition source was
also calibrated by using the measured ceiling thermocouple temperatures. The resulting HRR curve was input into FDS as a fire ramp.
A summary of the eight tests selected for model validation is shown in Table~\ref{tab:NIST_Smoke_Alarms_Summary}.

\section{NRCC Facade Heat Flux Measurements}

A series of experiments was conducted by the Fire Research Section of the Institute for Research in Construction, National Research Council of Canada (NRCC),
to measure the heat flux to a mock exterior building facade due to a fire within a compartment~\cite{Oleszkiewicz:ASME,Oleszkiewicz:FireTech}. The experiments selected for model
validation were conducted using a series of propane line burners within a compartment whose interior dimensions were 5.95~m wide, 4.4~m deep, and 2.75~m high (see
Fig.~\ref{NRCC_Facade_Drawing}). There
were five different door/window sizes:
\begin{enumerate}
\item 0.94 m by 2.00 m high
\item 0.94 m by 2.70 m high (door)
\item 2.60 m by 1.37 m high (shown in Fig.~\ref{NRCC_Facade_Drawing})
\item 2.60 m by 2.00 m high
\item 2.60 m by 2.70 m high (door)
\end{enumerate}
There were four fire sizes: 5.5~MW, 6.9~MW, 8.6~MW, and 10.3~MW. In all, 19 experiments were conducted, with the exception of the 10.3~MW fire with Window~1. In each
experiment, heat flux measurements were made 0.5~m, 1.5~m, 2.5~m, and 3.5~m above the top of the door/window.

%\section{NRL Confined Space Experiments}
%
%The U.S. Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) performed a multi-year series of experiments inside of a four level,
%23 compartment test facility with 20 doors and ceiling vents whose exterior boundaries were airtight~\cite{Confined_JFPE} ~\cite{Confined_DTIC}.
%Three HVAC systems were installed in the facility: a supply air system that takes suction from a fan room and discharges the air to the each of the compartments,
%an exhaust system that takes suction from each of the compartments and discharges it to the fan room, and a smoke control control system that takes suction from an upper
%level compartment and discharges it to the ambient (see Figure~\ref{confined_HVAC}).
%A second set of HVAC ducts directly connected the second level with the fourth level (see Figure~\ref{confined_bypass}).

\section{NRL/HAI Wall Heat Flux Measurements}

Back, Beyler, DiNenno and Tatem~\cite{Back:IAFSS4} measured the heat flux from 9 different sized propane fires set up against a wall composed
of gypsum board. The experiments were sponsored by the Naval Research Laboratory and conducted by Hughes Associates, Inc., of Baltimore, Maryland. The
square sand burner ranged in size from 0.28~m to 0.70~m, and the fires ranged in size from 50~kW to 520~kW.

\section{PRISME Project}

PRISME is the name of a fire test program conducted under the auspices of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, Nuclear Energy Agency (OECD/NEA). The experiments were conducted at the French Institut de radioprotection et de s\^{u}ret\'{e} nucl\'{e}aire (IRSN) at Cadarache. A variety of experiments were conducted to study ventilation effects, electrical cable failure, and leakage~\cite{Dreisbach:Interflam}.

\section{Purdue Flames}

A turbulent buoyant diffusion flame is established on a diffuser burner with an exit diameter of 7.1 cm. The diverging angle of the burner is 7$^\circ$ such that the gaseous fuel (methane) is decelerated and forms a uniform velocity distribution at the burner exit \cite{Xin:CF2005}. The methane (CH4) mass flow rate (84.3 mg/s) The buoyant diffusion flame burns in a quiescent atmospheric pressure environment. The flame is surrounded by a screened enclosure to minimize flame disturbance. The Froude number of the flame is 0.109 and matches that of a 7.1 cm diameter liquid toluene pool fire \cite{Xin:CF2005,Zhou:CS1998}. The total heat release rate of the methane flame is 4.2 kW under the assumption of complete combustion, and the visible flame height is approximately 36 cm \cite{Xin:CF2005}. Measured and computed vertical and horizontal velocity, mixture fraction, and temperature values for this flame have been reported by Xin et al.~\cite{Xin:CF2005,Xin:PhD2002} and Zhou et al.~\cite{Zhou:CS1998,Zhou:PurduePhD1999}. The mean temperatures have been inferred from the measured species concentrations \cite{Xin:CF2005} by assuming an adiabatic flame. The interdependencies between species concentrations, temperature and specific heat have been ignored for determining the mean temperature.

\section{Restivo Compartment Air Flow Experiment}

Velocity measurements for forced airflow within a 9~m by 3~m by 3~m high compartment were made by Restivo~\cite{Restivo:1979}. These measurements
have been widely used to validate CFD models designed for indoor air quality applications. It was also used to assess early versions of
FDS~\cite{Emmerich:1,Emmerich:2,Musser:1}. In the experiment, air was forced into the compartment through a 16.8~cm vertical slot along the ceiling
running the width of the compartment with a velocity of 0.455~m/s. A passive exhaust was located near the floor on the opposite wall, with
conditions specified such that there was no buildup of pressure in the enclosure. The component
of velocity in the lengthwise direction was measured in four arrays: two vertical arrays located 3~m and 6~m  from the inlet along the
centerline of the room, and two horizontal arrays located 8.4~cm above the floor and below the ceiling, respectively.
These measurements were taken using hot-wire anemometers. While data on the specific
instrumentation used are not readily available, hot-wire systems tend to have limitations at low velocities,
with typical thresholds of approximately 0.1~m/s.

\section{Sandia Plume Experiments}

The Fire Laboratory for Accreditation of Models by Experimentation (FLAME) facility \cite{OHern:2005,Blanchat:2001} at Sandia National Laboratories in Albuquerque, New Mexico, is designed specifically for validating models of buoyant fire plumes.  The plume source is 1 m in diameter surrounded by a 0.5 m steel `ground plane'. PIV/PLIF techniques are used to obtain instantaneous joint scalar and velocity fields.  O'Hern et al.~\cite{OHern:2005} studied a turbulent buoyant helium plume in the FLAME facility. Earlier work to model this experiment has been performed by DesJardin et al.~\cite{DesJardin:2004}. Tieszen et al.~\cite{Tieszen:2004,Tieszen:2002} studied methane and hydrogen pool fires.

\section{Sippola Aerosol Deposition Experiments}

Mark Sippola, a doctoral student at the University of California, Berkeley, measured aerosol
deposition velocities for various sizes of monodisperse fluorescent particles and various air
velocities in a duct \cite{Sippola:2002,Sippola:2010}. For the experiments considered here,
the straight steel duct with smooth walls was square with dimensions of 15~cm by 15~cm. The
particle diameters were 1~$\mu$m, 3~$\mu$m, 5~$\mu$m, 9~$\mu$m, and 16~$\mu$m. The air velocities
in the duct were 2.2~m/s, 5.3~m/s, and 9.0~m/s. A total of twelve panels (20~cm by 10~cm) were cut
from the duct section to measure the amount of particles deposited to the duct surfaces; four
panels each from the duct ceiling, wall, and floor surfaces. Fluorescent measurement techniques
and aerosol concentration measurements were used to calculate the deposition velocities of the
particles to duct surfaces (ceiling, wall, and floor) at two straight duct sections where the
turbulent flow profile was fully developed.

\section{Smyth Slot Burner Experiment}

Kermit Smyth et al.~conducted diffusion flame experiments at NIST using a methane/air Wolfhard-Parker slot burner. The experiments are described in detail in Refs.~\cite{Norton:1,Smyth:1}. The Wolfhard-Parker slot burner consists of an 8~mm wide central slot flowing fuel surrounded by two 16~mm wide slots flowing dry air with 1~mm separations between the slots.
The slots are 41~mm in length. Measurements were made of all major species and a number of minor species along with temperature and velocity. Experimental uncertainties have been reported as 5~\% for temperature  and 10~\% to 20~\%
for the major species.

\section{SP Adiabatic Surface Temperature Experiments}

In 2008, three compartment experiments were performed at SP Technical Research Institute of Sweden under the sponsorship of Brandforsk, the Swedish Fire Research Board~\cite{Wickstrom_AST}. The objective of the experiments was to demonstrate how plate thermometer measurements in the vicinity of a simple steel beam can be used to supply the boundary conditions for a multi-dimensional heat conduction calculation for the beam. The adiabatic surface temperature was derived from the plate temperatures.

The experiments were performed inside a standard compartment designed for corner fire testing (ISO 9705). The compartment is 3.6~m deep, 2.4~m wide and 2.4~m high and includes a door opening 0.8~m by 2.0~m. The room was constructed of 20~cm thick light weight concrete blocks with a density of 600~kg/m$^3$~$\pm$~100~kg/m$^3$. The heat source was a gas burner run at a constant power of 450~kW. The top of the burner, with a square opening 30~cm by 30~cm, was placed 65~cm above the floor, 2.5~cm from the walls. A single steel beam was suspended 20~cm below the ceiling along the centerline of the compartment. There were three measurement stations along the beam at lengths of 0.9~m (Position A), 1.8~m (Position B), and 2.7~m (Position C) from the far wall where the fire was either positioned in the corner (Tests 1 and 2), or the center (Test 3). The beam in Test 1 was a rectangular steel tube filled with an insulation material. The beam in Tests 2 and 3 was an I-beam. A diagram of the room used in Tests 2 and 3 is displayed in Figure~\ref{Room_Drawing}.

\caption{Geometry of the  SP/AST compartment for Tests 2 and 3}
\label{Room_Drawing}
\end{figure}

A second series of experiments involving plate thermometers was carried out in 2011~\cite{Sjostrom:AST}.
A 6~m long, 20~cm diameter vertical steel column was positioned in the center of 1.1~m and 1.9~m diesel fuel and 1.1~m heptane
pool fires. Gas, plate thermometer, and surface temperatures were measured at heights of 1~m, 2~m, 3~m, 4~m, and 5~m above the pool surface. These experiments are notable because
the column is partially engulfed in flames.

\section{Steckler Compartment Experiments}

Steckler, Quintiere and Rinkinen performed a set of 55 compartment fire tests at NBS in 1979. The compartment was 2.8~m by 2.8~m by 2.13~m high\footnote{The test report
gives the height of the compartment as 2.18~m. This is a misprint. The compartment was 2.13~m high.}, with a single door of
various widths, or alternatively a single window with various heights. A 30~cm diameter methane burner was used to generate fires with heat release rates of
31.6~kW, 62.9~kW, 105.3~kW and 158~kW. Vertical profiles of velocity and temperature were measured in the doorway, along with a single vertical profile of temperature
within the compartment.
A full description and results are reported in Reference~\cite{Steckler:NBSIR_82-2520}. The basic test matrix is listed in Table~\ref{Steckler_Table}. Note that the
test report does not include a detailed description of the compartment. However, an internal report\footnote{ {\em Technical Research Report, Fire Induced Flows
Through Room Openings - Flow Coefficients}, Project 203005-003, Armstrong Cork Company, Lancaster, Pennsylvania, May, 1981.} by the test sponsor, Armstrong Cork Company,
reports that the compartment floor was composed of 19~mm calcium silicate board on top of 12.7~mm plywood on wood joists. The walls and ceiling consisted of
12.7~mm ceramic fiber insulation board over 0.66~mm aluminum sheet attached to wood studs. A diagram of the compartment is displayed in Figure~\ref{Steckler_ Drawing}.

\section{UL/NIST Vent Experiments}
\label{UL_NIST_Vents_Description}

In 2012, the Fire Fighting Technology Group at NIST conducted experiments at Underwriters Laboratories (UL) in Northbrook, Illinois, to assess the change in compartment temperature due to the opening of one or two 1.2~m square ceiling vents. Four experiments were conducted using a natural gas burner in a 6.1~m by 4.3~m by 2.4~m compartment with a single door opening. The fires ranged in size from 500~kW to 2~MW, and the vents were opened and closed such that during the four experiments there were 31 discrete time intervals in which model predictions could be compared to quasi-steady conditions. The compartment contained two vertical arrays of thermocouples, and the door and vents were instrumented with thermocouples and bi-directional velocity probes. Only the thermocouple data has been used in the validation study. A diagram of the compartment is displayed in Figure~\ref{UL_NIST_Drawing}. The major test parameters are listed in Table~\ref{UL_NIST_Table}.

\section{UL/NFPRF Sprinkler, Vent, and Draft Curtain Study}
\label{UL_NFPRF_Description}

In 1997, thirty-four heptane spray burner and five racked commodity experiments were conducted at the Large Scale Fire Test Facility at Underwriters Laboratories (UL) in Northbrook, Illinois~\cite{Sheppard:1,McGrattan:5}. The spray burner experiments were divided into two test series. Series I consisted of 22 4.4~MW experiments. Series~II consisted of 12 10~MW experiments. The objective of the spray burner experiments was to characterize the temperature and flow field for fire scenarios with a controlled heat release rate in the presence of sprinklers, draft curtains, and smoke \& heat vents.

The Large Scale Fire Test Facility at UL contains a 37~m by 37~m (120~ft by 120~ft) main fire test cell, equipped with a 30.5~m by 30.5~m (100~ft by 100~ft) adjustable height ceiling. The UL/NFPRF test results (Series I) are summarized in Table~\ref{ULmatrix}. The UL/NFPRF test results (Series II) are summarized in Table~\ref{ULburnermatrixII}. The layout of the experiments is shown in Figs.~\ref{layout}, \ref{burnerlayoutA}, and \ref{layout3}.

{Results of Series~I of the UL/NFPRF heptane spray experiments. Note that DNO means ``Did Not Open''. Also note, the fires grew at a rate proportional to the square of the time until a certain flow rate of fuel was achieved at which time the flow rate was held steady. Thus, the ``Heat Release Rate'' was the size of the fire at the time when the fuel supply was leveled off.}

\end{figure}

\begin{description}
\item[Ceiling:] The ceiling was raised to a height of 7.6~m and instrumented with thermocouples and other measurement devices. The ceiling was constructed of 0.6~m by 1.2~m by 1.6~cm UL fire-rated Armstrong Ceramaguard (Item 602B) ceiling tiles. The manufacturer reported the thermal properties of the material to be: specific heat 753 J/(kg$\cdot$K), thermal conductivity 0.0611~W/(m$\cdot$K), and density 313~kg/m$^3$.
\item[Draft Curtains:] Sheet metal, 1.2~mm thick and 1.8~m deep, was suspended from the ceiling for 16 of the 22 Series~I tests, enclosing an area of about 450~m$^2$ and 49 sprinklers. The curtains were in place for all of the Series~II tests.
\item[Sprinklers:] Central ELO-231 (Extra Large Orifice) uprights were used for all the tests. The orifice diameter of this sprinkler is reported by the manufacturer to be nominally 1.6~cm (0.64~in), the reference actuation temperature is reported by the manufacturer to be 74$^\circ$C (165$^\circ$F). The RTI (Response Time Index) and C-factor (Conductivity factor) were reported by UL to be 148~(m$\cdot$s)$^\ha$ and 0.7~(m/s)$^\ha$, respectively~\cite{Sheppard:1}. When installed, the sprinkler deflector was located 8~cm below the ceiling. The thermal element of the sprinkler was located 11~cm below the ceiling. The sprinklers were installed with nominal 3~m by 3~m (exact 10~ft by 10~ft) spacing in a system designed to deliver a constant 0.34~L/(s$\cdot$m$^2$) (0.50 gpm/ft$^2$) discharge density when supplied by a 131~kPa (19~psi) discharge pressure
\item[Vent:] UL-listed double leaf fire vents with steel covers and steel curb were installed in the adjustable height ceiling in the position shown in Figs.~\ref{layout} and \ref{burnerlayoutA}. The vent is designed to open manually or automatically. The vent doors were recessed into the ceiling about 0.3~m (1~ft).
\item[Heptane Spray Burner:] The heptane spray burner consisted of a 1~m by 1~m square of 1.3~cm pipe supported by four cement blocks 0.6~m off the floor. Four atomizing spray nozzles were used to provide a free spray of heptane that was then ignited. For all but one of the Series~I tests, the total heat release rate from the fire was manually ramped up following a ``t-squared'' curve to a steady-state in 75~s (150~s was used in Test I-16). The fire was ramped to 10~MW in 75~s for the Series~II tests. The fire growth curve was followed until a specified fire size was reached or the first sprinkler activated. After either of these events, the fire size was maintained at that level until conditions reached roughly a steady state, i.e., the temperatures recorded near the ceilings remained steady and no more sprinkler activations occurred. The heat release rate from the burner was confirmed by placing it under the large product calorimeter at UL, ramping up the flow of heptane in the same manner as in the tests, and measuring the total and convective heat release rates. It was found that the convective heat release rate was 0.65~$\pm$~0.02 of the total.
\item[Plastic Commodity:] The Factory Mutual Research Corporation (FMRC) standard ``Group A Plastic'' test commodity served as the fuel for the rack storage experiments~\cite{Troup:1}. The cartoned plastic commodity consists of rigid crystalline polystyrene cups packaged in compartmented, single-wall, corrugated paper cartons. Each carton is a cube 0.53~m (21~in) on a side. Eight boxes comprise a pallet load. Two-way, slatted deck hardwood pallets support the loads.  A pallet load weighs approximately 80~kg (170~lb), of which about 36~\% is plastic, 35~\% is wood, and 29~\% is corrugated paper~\cite{Troup:1}. Each storage array consisted of a main (ignition) double-row rack at the center, flanked on two sides by single row target racks. The rows were separated by 8~ft wide aisles.  Each of the two rows of the main array consisted of four 2.4~m (8~ft) long bays; a 0.15~m (6~in) flue separated the rows. Longitudinal flues of 0.2~m (7.5~in) were used to separate the pallets within a row. The overall loaded area of the double-row rack measured approximately 2.3~m (7.5~ft) wide by 10~m (33~ft) long.  The racks were divided vertically into 4 tiers; the overall loaded height was 5.8~m (19~ft). The fire was ignited with 2 standard igniters which consisted of 8~cm (3~in) long by 8~cm diameter cylinders of rolled cotton material, each soaked in 120~mL (4~oz) of gasoline and enclosed in a polyethylene bag.  The rolls were placed against the carton surfaces in the first tier, just above the pallet. The igniters were lit with a flaming propane torch at the start of each test.
\item[Instrumentation:] The instrumentation for the tests consisted of thermocouples, gas analysis equipment, and pressure transducers. The locations of the instrumentation are referenced in the plan view of the facility (Fig.~\ref{layout}). Temperature measurements were recorded at 104 locations. Type K 0.0625~in diameter Inconel sheathed thermocouples were positioned to measure (i) temperatures near the ceiling, (ii) temperatures of the ceiling jet, and (iii) temperatures near the vent.

\section{Ulster SBI Corner Heat Flux Measurements}

Zhang et al.~\cite{Zhang:IAFSS9} measured the heat flux and flame heights from
fires in the single burning item (SBI) enclosure at the University of Ulster, Northern Ireland.
Thin steel plate probes were used to measure the surface heat flux, and flame
heights were determined by analyzing the instantaneous images extracted from the videos of the
experiments by a CCD camera. Three heat release rates were used -- 30~kW, 45~kW, and 60~kW.



\section{USCG/HAI Water Mist Suppression Tests}

The U.S. Coast Guard sponsored a series of experiments to assess the fire suppression capabilities of a variety of water mist systems in a variety of ship board configurations. The
experiments were conducted in 1999 by Hughes Associates, Inc., in a simulated machinery space aboard the test vessel {\em State of Maine} at the USCG Fire and Safety Test Detachment,
Mobile, Alabama~\cite{Back:USCG1999}.
The space had nominal dimensions of 7~m by 5~m by 3~m, containing two steel engine mock-ups each measuring 3~m by 1~m by 1.5~m. The space was equipped with a door
for natural ventilation and a forced ventilation system providing approximately 15 air changes per hour. Five commercially available water mist systems were evaluated. The
obstructed heptane spray fires ranged in size from approximately 250~kW to 1~MW.



\section{USN High Bay Hangar Experiments}

The U.S. Navy sponsored a series of 33 tests within two hangars examining fire detection and sprinkler activation in response to spill fires in large enclosures. Experiments were conducted using JP-5 and JP-8 fuels in two Navy high bay aircraft hangars located in Naval Air Stations in Barber's Point, Hawaii and Keflavik, Iceland.

The Hawaii tests were conducted in a 15~m high hangar measuring 97.8~m in length and 73.8~m in width. Of the 13 tests conducted in the facility 11 were conducted in pans ranging from .09~m$^2$ to 4.9~m$^2$ in area with heat release rates varying from 100~kW to 7.7~MW. The burner was placed in the center of the room on a scale that continuously recorded the pans weight. The facility was equipped with a number of detection devices including thermocouples, electronic smoke and spot heat detectors, projected beam smoke detectors, combination UV/IR optical flame detectors, line-type heat detectors, as well as sprinklers. Measurements were recorded at a large number of locations allowing for a thorough profile of compartment behavior.

It was suspected that fire plume behavior and response of detection devices in a cold building may not have been well replicated by the experiments held in the warm hangar in Hawaii. The Iceland tests were conducted under a 22~m barrel vaulted ceiling in a hangar measuring 45.7~m by 73.8~m. 22 tests in total were conducted. The majority of these tests fires burned JP-5 fuel with the remainder burning JP-8. The jet fuel fires ranged in size from .06~m$^2$ to 20.9~m$^2$ and in heat release rate from 100~kW to approximately 33~MW. The facility was equipped similarly to the Hawaii hangar.



\section{Vettori Flat Ceiling Experiments}

Vettori~\cite{Vettori:1} analyzed a series of 45 experiments conducted at NIST that were intended to compare the effects of different ceiling configurations on the activation times of quick response residential pendent sprinklers. The two ceiling configurations used consisted of an obstructed ceiling, with parallel beams 0.038~m wide by 0.24~m deep placed 0.41~m on center, and a smooth ceiling configuration, in which the beams were covered by a sheet of gypsum board.  In addition to the two ceiling configurations, there were also three fire growth rates and three burner locations used -- a total of 18 test configurations. The fire growth rate was provided by a computer controlled methane gas burner to mimic a standard t-squared fire growth rate with either a slow, medium, or fast ramp up. The burner was placed in a corner of the room, then against an adjacent wall, and then in a location removed from any wall. Measurements were taken to record sprinkler activation time, temperatures at varying heights and locations within the room, and the ceiling jet velocities at several other locations.  A diagram of the test structure is displayed in Figure~\ref{Vettori_Drawing}.

\section{Vettori Sloped Ceiling Experiments}

Vettori~\cite{Vettori:2} performed a series of 72 compartment experiments to measure the activation times of quick-response residential pendent sprinklers mounted under a ceiling with an adjustable slope. There were 36 unique configurations (2 replicates of each) combining the following parameters:
\begin{itemize}
\item \underline{F}lat, \underline{13}$^\circ$, or \underline{24}$^\circ$ Ceiling Slope
\item \underline{S}mooth or \underline{O}bstructed Ceiling Surface
\item \underline{F}ast or \underline{S}low Growth Fire
\item \underline{C}orner, \underline{W}all, or \underline{D}etached Burner Location
\end{itemize}





\section{VTT Large Hall Tests}

The experiments are described in Ref.~\cite{Hostikka:VTT2104}. The series consisted of 8 experiments, but because of replicates only three unique fire
scenarios. The experiments were undertaken to study the movement of smoke in a large hall with a sloped ceiling. The tests were conducted inside the
VTT Fire Test Hall, with dimensions of 19~m high by 27~m long by 14~m wide. Each test involved a single heptane pool fire, ranging from 2~MW to 4~MW.
Four types of predicted output were used in the present evaluation -- the HGL temperature and depth, average flame height and the plume
temperature. Three vertical arrays of thermocouples (TC), plus two thermocouples in the plume, were compared to FDS predictions. The HGL
temperature and height were reduced from an average of the three TC
arrays using the standard algorithm described in
Chapter~\ref{HGL:Chapter}. The ceiling jet temperature was not
considered, because the ceiling in the test hall is not flat, and the
standard model algorithm is not appropriate for this geometry.

The VTT test report lacks some information needed to model the experiments, which is why some information was based on private communications with the
principal investigator, Simo Hostikka.
\begin{description}
\item[Surface Materials:] The walls and ceiling of the test hall consist of a 1~mm thick layer of sheet metal on top of a 5~cm layer of mineral wool. The floor was constructed of concrete. The report does not provide thermal properties of these materials.
\item[Natural Ventilation:] In Cases~1 and 2, all doors were closed, and ventilation was restricted to infiltration through the building envelope. Precise information on air infiltration during these tests is not available. The scientists who conducted the experiments recommend a leakage area of about 2~m$^2$, distributed uniformly throughout the enclosure. By contrast, in Case~3, the doors located in each end wall (Doors 1 and 2, respectively) were open to the external ambient environment. These doors are each 0.8~m wide by 4~m high, and are located such that their centers are 9.3~m from the south wall.
\item[Mechanical Ventilation:] The test hall has a single mechanical exhaust duct, located in the roof space, running along the center of the building. This duct had a circular section with a diameter of 1~m, and opened horizontally to the hall at a distance of 12~m from the floor and 10.5~m from the west wall. Mechanical exhaust ventilation was operational for Case~3, with a constant volume flow rate of 11~m$^3$/s drawn through the exhaust duct.
\item[Heat Release Rate:] Each test used a single liquid fuel pan with its center located 16~m from the west wall and 7.4~m from the south wall. For all tests, the fuel was heptane in a circular steel pan that was partially filled with water. The pan had a diameter of 1.17~m for Case~1 and 1.6~m for Cases~2 and 3. In each case, the fuel surface was 1~m above the floor. The trays were placed on load cells, and the HRR was calculated from the mass loss rate. For the three cases, the fuel mass loss rate was averaged from individual replicate tests. In the HRR estimation, the heat of combustion (taken as 44,600~kJ/kg) and the combustion efficiency for n-heptane was used. Hostikka suggests a value of 0.8 for the combustion efficiency. Tewarson reports a value of 0.93 for a 10~cm pool fire~\cite{SFPE:Tewarson}. For the calculations reported in the current study, a combustion efficiency of 0.85 is assumed. In general, an uncertainty of 15~\% has been assumed for the reported HRR of most of the large scale fire experiments used.
\item[Radiative Fraction:] The radiative fraction was assumed to be 0.35, similar to many smoky hydrocarbons.

\section{Water mist characterization tests}

 A single water mist nozzle was characterized for validation purposes. The experiment was conducted at Tampere University of technology using Direct Imaging technique. The experiments are described in more detail in \cite{vaari:2012}. The characterized  nozzle  was the LN-2 nozzle by Spraying Systems Co.. It belongs to the fine spray hydraulic atomizing nozzle family and is of the standard spray small capacity type. Measurements were made 40  cm and 62cm below the nozzle. Measured quantities average droplet velocity, droplet flux and average diameter.







\section{WTC Spray Burner Test Series}

As part of its investigation of the World Trade Center disaster, the Building and Fire Research Laboratory at NIST conducted several series of fire experiments to both gain insight into the observed fire behavior and also to validate FDS for use in reconstructing the fires. The first series of experiments involved a relatively simple compartment with a liquid spray burner and various structural elements with varying amounts of sprayed fire-resistive materials (SFRM). A diagram of the compartment is shown in Fig.~\ref{WTC_Drawing}. A complete description of the experiments can be found in the NIST WTC report NCSTAR~1-5B~\cite{NIST_NCSTAR_1-5B}. The overall enclosure was rectangular, as were the vents and most of the obstructions. The compartment walls and ceiling were made of 2.54~cm thick marinite. The manufacturer provided the thermal properties of the material used in the calculation. The density was 737~kg/m$^3$, conductivity 0.12~W/m/K. The specific heat ranged from 1.17~kJ/kg/K at 93~$^\circ$C to 1.42~kJ/kg/K at 425~$^\circ$C. This value was assumed for higher temperatures. The steel used to construct the column and truss flanges was 0.64~cm thick.  The density of the steel was assumed to be 7,860~kg/m$^3$; its specific heat 0.45~kJ/kg/K.

Two fuels were used in the tests. The properties of the fuels were obtained from measurements made on a series of unconfined burns that are referenced in the test report. The first fuel was a blend of heptane isomers, C$_7$H$_{16}$. Its soot yield was set at a constant 1.5~\%. The second fuel was a mixture (40~\% - 60~\% by mass) of toluene, C$_7$H$_8$, and heptane. Because FDS only considers the burning of a single hydrocarbon fuel, the mixture was taken to be C$_7$H$_{12}$ with a soot yield of 11.4~\%. The radiative fraction for the heptane blend was 0.44; for the heptane/toluene mixture it was 0.39. The heat release rate of the simulated burner was set to that which was measured in the experiments. The spray burner was modeled using reported properties of the nozzle and liquid fuel droplets.

\section{Summary of Experiments}

\label{experiment_summary}

Table~\ref{Test_Parameters} presents a summary of all the experiments described in this chapter in terms of parameters commonly used in fire protection engineering. This ``parameter space'' outlines the range of applicability of the validation studies performed to date. In other words, if this guide is to be cited as justification for using FDS to simulate a given fire scenario, that scenario must be similar to these experiments in the sense of having comparable physical parameters. These parameters are explained below:

\begin{description}
\item[Heat Release Rate, $\dQ$,] is the range of peak heat release rates of the fires in the test series.
\item[Fire Diameter, $D$,] is the equivalent diameter of the base of the fire, calculated $D=\sqrt{4A/\pi}$, where $A$ is the area of the base.
\item[Ceiling Height, $H$,] is the distance from floor to ceiling.
\item[Fire Froude Number, $\dot{Q}^*$,] is a useful non-dimensional quantity for plume correlations and flame height estimates. \be \dot{Q}^* = \frac{\dot{Q}}{\rho_\infty c_p T_\infty \sqrt{gD} D^2} \ee It is essentially the ratio of the fuel gas exit velocity and the buoyancy-induced plume velocity. Jet fires are characterized by large Froude numbers. Typical accidental fires have a Froude number near unity.
\item[Flame Height relative to Ceiling Height, $L_{\rm f}/H$,] is a convenient way to express the physical size of the fire relative to the size of the room. The height of the visible flame, based on Heskestad's correlation, is estimated by: \be L_{\rm f} = D \, \left( 3.7 \, (\dot{Q}^*)^{2/5} - 1.02 \right) \ee
\item[Global Equivalence Ratio, $\phi$,] is the ratio of the mass flux of fuel to the mass flux of oxygen into the compartment, divided by the stoichiometric ratio. \be \phi = \frac{\dm_{\rm f}}{r\, \dm_{\hbox{\tiny O$_2$}}} \equiv  \frac{\dQ \; \hbox{(kW)}}{13,100 \; \hbox{(kJ/kg)} \; \dm_{\hbox{\tiny O$_2$}} } \quad ; \quad  \dm_{\hbox{\tiny O$_2$}} = \left\{
     \begin{array}{r@{\quad:\quad}l}
      \ha \, 0.23 \, A_0 \sqrt{H_0} & \hbox{Natural Ventilation} \\
      0.23 \, \rho \, \dot{V}       & \hbox{Mechanical Ventilation} \end{array} \right. \ee Here, $r$ is the stoichiometric ratio, $A_0$ is the area of the compartment opening, $H_0$ is the height of the opening, $\rho$ is the density of air, and $\dot{V}$ is the volume flow of air into the compartment. If $\phi<1$, the compartment is considered ``well-ventilated'' and if $\phi>1$, the compartment is considered ``under-ventilated.''
\item[Compartment Aspect Ratios, $W/H$ and $L/H$,] indicate if the compartment is shaped like a hallway, typical room, or vertical shaft.
\item[Relative Distance along the Ceiling, $r_{\rm cj}/H$,] indicates the distance from the fire plume of a sprinkler, smoke detector, etc., relative to the compartment height, $H$.
\item[Relative Distance from the Fire, $r_{\rm rad}/D$,] indicates whether a ``target'' is near or far from the fire.

\noindent
Table~\ref{Numerical_Parameters} lists a few important parameters related to the numerical resolution of the calculation.
\begin{description}
\item[Characteristic Fire Diameter, $D^*$,] is a useful length scale that incorporates the heat release rate of the fire.
\be D^* = \left( \frac{\dot{Q}}{\rho_\infty c_p T_\infty \sqrt{g}} \right)^{2/5}  \ee
\item[Plume Resolution Index, $D^*/\dx$,] is the number of grid cells of length $\dx$ that span the characteristic diameter of the fire. The greater its value, the more ``resolved'' are the fire dynamics.
\item[Ceiling Height relative to Fire Diameter, $H/D^*$,] is the non-dimensional height of the smoke plume.
\end{description}
Note that the calculations performed for the various validation studies described in this Guide use a wide range of values of the Plume Resolution Index, $D^*/\dx$. There are several reasons for this. First, typical applications of FDS often involve relatively small fires in relatively large spaces, and it is impractical to use a very fine grid that captures the detailed fire dynamics. Second, for some applications the accuracy of calculation is highly dependent on resolving the plume well, but for others, it is less important. For those citing the validation studies in this Guide, it is important that both the physical and numerical parameters are comparable to the given application.
