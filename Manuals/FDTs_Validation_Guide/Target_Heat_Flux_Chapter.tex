\section{Point Source Radiation Heat Flux}

\subsubsection*{Description}

The point source model assumes that radiative energy is concentrated at a point located within a flame~\cite{Beyler2:SFPE}.
Here, the point source is located at a point one-third the height of the flame.
The radiative heat flux, $\dot q_r''$, at any distance $R$ (\si{m}) from this point can be predicted using
\be
\dot q_r'' = \cos\theta \left( \frac{\chi_r \dot Q}{4 \pi R^2} \right) \quad \si{kW/m^2}
\label{eq:point_source}
\ee
where the $\cos\theta$ term (equal to $x/R$ for targets facing sideways, or $z/R$ for gauges facing upward or downward) accounts for a target that is at an angle $\theta$ from the source. The IOR orientation parameter is used to specify which direction the target or gauge is facing: 1 or -1 for the positive or negative $x$ direction, 2 or -2 for the positive or negative $y$ direction, and 3 or -3 for the positive or negative $z$ direction. $\chi_r$ is the radiative fraction~(-), $\dot Q$ is the HRR of the fire~(\si{kW}), and $R$ is the radial distance from the point source to the edge of the target~(\si{m}) and is given by
\be
R = \sqrt{x^2 + \left(z - \frac{L_f}{3} \right)^2}
\label{eq:point_source_R}
\ee
where $x$ is the horizontal distance from the point source to the edge of the target~(\si{m}), $z$ is the height of the heat flux target~(\si{m}). The flame height, $L_f$ (\si{m}), is given by
\be
L_f = D (3.7 Q^{*^{2/5}} - 1.02)
\label{eq:point_source_Lf}
\ee
where $D$ is the diameter of the fire source~(\si{m}) and is given by
\be
D = \sqrt{\frac{4 A}{\pi}}
\label{eq:point_source_D}
\ee
where $A$ is the area of the fire source~(m$^2$). The nondimensional HRR, $Q^*$, is given by
\be
Q^* = \frac{\dot Q}{\rho_\infty c_p T_\infty \sqrt{g} D^{5/2}}
\label{eq:point_source_Qstar}
\ee
where $\rho_\infty$ is the ambient air density~(\si{kg/m^3}), $c_p$ is the specific heat of air~(\si{kJ/(kg.K)}), $T_\infty$ is the ambient air temperature~(\si{K}), and $g$ is the acceleration of gravity~(\si{m/s^2}).

\subsubsection*{Verification}

Test: Fleury 100 kW, 1:1 Burner
\\ \\
\noindent In the FDTs spreadsheets, the point source radiation heat flux is calculated without accounting for the angle/elevation
of the target with respect to the fire, and the flame height is not considered. The FDTs.f90 program considers both of these and
assumes that the point source is located one-third of the height of the flame ($L_f/3$).

\noindent Expected result (FDTs spreadsheets): At a radius $R$ of 0.67~m, the radiative heat flux $q''_{r}$ is 6.22~kW/m$^2$; at an $R$ of 0.92~m, $q''_{r}$ is 3.30~kW/m$^2$; at an $R$ of 1.17~m, $q''_{r}$ is 2.04~kW/m$^2$.

\noindent Expected result (FDTs.f90): At a radius $R$ of 0.50~m, the radiative heat flux $q''_{r}$ is 6.01~kW/m$^2$; at an $R$ of 0.75~m, $q''_{r}$ is 3.65~kW/m$^2$; at an $R$ of 1.0~m, $q''_{r}$ is 2.33~kW/m$^2$.
