# FDS Verification

The folders above contain the FDS verification input files that are run each night by the firebot script contained in the repository [firemodels/bot](https://github.com/firemodels/bot). Detailed instructions for running and processing the verification cases are found in the wiki [FDS Verification Process](https://github.com/firemodels/fds/wiki/FDS-Verification-Process).
