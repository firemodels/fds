<p><hr size="1">
<p>Latest FDS and Smokeview available at 
<a href="http://fire.nist.gov/fds">http://fire.nist.gov/fds</a>
<ul>
<li>5.2.7 (build 2602) - November 4, 2008
<ol>
<li>change - smokezip now requires the user to specifiy the minimum and maximum data bounds when compressing boundary files.  
This now makes the treatment of boundary and slice files consistent (and more correct).
<li>fix - correct skip frame option in both Smokeview and Smokezip allowing users to load bigger cases by skipping data frames.
(<a href="http://code.google.com/p/fds-smv/issues/detail?id=513&can=1&sort=-id">Issue 513</a>).
<li>fix - correct option to smooth blockages from menu when blockages are already cached
(<a href="http://code.google.com/p/fds-smv/issues/detail?id=510&can=1&sort=-id">Issue 510</a>).
</ol>
<li>5.2.6 (build 2554) - October 24, 2008
<ol>
<li>enhancement - add option to display tracer particles (no value assigned) and particles with values
simultaneously.  Option is activated using the Show/Hide>Particles menu or the File/Bounds dialog box.
<li>enhancement - add support for transparency and shininess to the CAD file format
<li>fix - save particle color state in .ini file so that the same view is presented if particles are reloaded.
(<a href="http://code.google.com/p/fds-smv/issues/detail?id=489&can=1&sort=-id">Issue 489</a>).
<li>fix - fix color display of CAD output when smoke is also displayed
(<a href="http://code.google.com/p/fds-smv/issues/detail?id=491&can=1&sort=-id">Issue 491</a>).
</ol>
<li>5.2.5 (build 2466) - October 8, 2008
<ol>
<li>enhancement - add value labels to isosurface menus to make clear which surfaces are being displayed
(<a href="http://code.google.com/p/fds-smv/issues/detail?id=473&can=1&sort=-id">Issue 473</a>).
<li>change - change terminology from "Show ignited" to "Show temperature threshold" in the boundary value File/Bounds dialog box
to make clear that hilighted regions are not necessarily
burning but have simply exceeded a specified temperature threshold value.
<li>fix - Update the smooth blockage cache file if a case has been re-run in order to avoid reading that is out of date.
<li>fix - make particles and smoke conform to terrain if terrain is vertically exaggerated .
</ol>
<li>5.2.4 (build 2236) - August 27, 2008
<ol>
<li>enhancement - add smoke sensor device used by Smokeview to detect opacity level or optical depth of intervening smoke.
<li>enhancement - record colorbar state in the .ini file (use of texture color map, colorbar selection index)
<li>enhancement - add PLOT3D state to .ini file and add scripting support for PLOT3D files.
<li>fix - make requirements for GPU and smoke culling consistent.  Both options now require OpenGL 2.0 or greater.
<li>fix - fix cad display option when displaying devices.
(<a href="http://code.google.com/p/fds-smv/issues/detail?id=449&can=1&sort=-id">Issue 449</a>).
<li>fix - fix clipping for transparent blockages. 
(<a href="http://code.google.com/p/fds-smv/issues/detail?id=446&can=1&sort=-id">Issue 446</a>).
</ol>
<li>5.2.3 (build 2136) - August 8, 2008
<ol>
<li>enhancement - save isosurface state (hidden=0, solid=1, outline=2, points=3) in .ini file
<li>enhancement - allow screen size to be updated when an .ini file is loaded from a script
<li>enhancement - save isosurface transparency state in .ini file
<li>enhancement - save vector length in .ini file
<li>enhancement - add LOADINIFILE script keyword to let one change Smokeview view settings 
during a script run.
</ol>
<li>5.2.2 (build 2050) - July 18, 2008
<ol>
<li>fix - Circular Tour was missing from Tour menu.  Fix by adding <em>Show Tours</em> menu when there is only one Tour.
(<a href="http://code.google.com/p/fds-smv/issues/detail?id=412&can=1&sort=-id">Issue 412</a>).
</ol>
<li>5.2 (build 2039) - July 17, 2008
<ol>
<li>enhancement - Add an option to speed up smoke visualization by using the 
graphics programming unit (GPU) to perform some of the needed computations.
This option is not supported on Linux or Mac OSX releases of Smokeview.  
The option is turned off
by default and may be toggled on and off by pressing the 'G' key.

<li>enhancement - add the ability to run Smokeview in a <em>batch</em> or unattended
mode.  This mode may be used to automatically load a data file, view it from 
a prescribed direction and render the resulting image.  This may be repeated for other views
and/or other data files.  A script named <em>casename.ssf</em> may be executed by typing
<p><tt>smokeview -runscript casename </tt>
<p>at a command line or from the <tt>Load/Unload>Script Options</tt> menu.
Scripts are created by adding desired commands to a text file named casename.ssf 
or by turning on the <em>script recorder</em> found in the 
Load/Unload>Script Options menu.

<li>enhancment - internal change in smokeview resulting in reduced memory 
requirements when loading large cases.

<li>enhancement - When performing WUI computations, allow slice and vector slice files to conform to a 
specified distance above the ground or terrain.

<li>fix - fix bug that occurs when reading the hrr csv file while it is being written to.

<li>fix - fix bug that occurs when drawing smoke on a computer without a GPU enabled video card.

<li>fix - force terrain normals to be smooth across mesh boundaries so that seams 
are not visible

<li>fix - fix time advance when adjusting 3D slice/vector files.

</ol>
<li>5.1.6 (build 1736) - May 31, 2008
<ol>
<li>enhancement - allow slice and vector slice files to conform to terrain (for WUI applications)
<li>fix - print out the keyword &TAIL at the end of the file when editing blockages
(<a href="http://code.google.com/p/fds-smv/issues/detail?id=366&can=1&sort=-id">Issue 366</a>).
<li>fix - fix display of PLOT3D contours
(<a href="http://code.google.com/p/fds-smv/issues/detail?id=361&can=1&sort=-id">Issue 361</a>).

</ol>
<li>5.1.5 (build 1666) - May 10, 2008
<ol>
<li>fix - fix display of hrrpuv cutoff value
(<a href="http://code.google.com/p/fds-smv/issues/detail?id=355&can=1&sort=-id">Issue 355</a>).
</ol>
<li>5.1.4 (build 1635) - May 5, 2008
<ol>
<li>enhancement - save smooth blockages to a file so that their definition may be read in rather than re-calculated.  
<li>enhancement - add an option to simplify file compression by compressing only files that were selected for auto-loading.
<li>enhancement - save the size preserving or perspective projection state in the .ini file
(<a href="http://code.google.com/p/fds-smv/issues/detail?id=331&can=1&sort=-id">Issue 331</a>).
<li>enhancement - implement the "AUTOTERRAIN" keyword for WUI applications of FDS.  If all blockages are used to implement terrain
(ie no blockages are used to represent buildings on the terrain), then AUTOTERRAIN is used to signal Smokeview to draw a smooth 
surface representing the terrain.
<li>enhancement -  add option to toggle slice file offset - 
(<a href="http://code.google.com/p/fds-smv/issues/detail?id=348&can=1&sort=-id">Issue 348</a>).
<li>enhancement - add support for skipping particle frames created by FDS 5 or later.
(<a href="http://code.google.com/p/fds-smv/issues/detail?id=350&can=1&sort=-id">Issue 350</a>).
<li>fix - For particle files created by FDS 5, remove the particle skip option as it is no longer supported. (<a href="http://code.google.com/p/fds-smv/issues/detail?id=350&can=1&sort=-id">Issue 350</a>).
<li>fix - change a conversion factor from 256*128 to 256*128-1 to avoid a "short int" overflow.   Otherwise, some
particles may be drawn outside the solution domain.
(<a href="http://code.google.com/p/fds-smv/issues/detail?id=323&can=1&sort=-id">Issue 323</a>).
<li>fix - fix the 't' toggle when the grid is turned on.
(<a href="http://code.google.com/p/fds-smv/issues/detail?id=334&can=1&sort=-id">Issue 334</a>).
<li>fix - force smooth blockages to be drawn opaquely to prevent drawing artifact errors when drawn with smoke.
(<a href="http://code.google.com/p/fds-smv/issues/detail?id=329&can=1&sort=-id">Issue 329</a>).
<li>fix - Fix drawing when smoke, iso and slice routines have non-increasing time steps.
This could occur when FDS is restarted to an earlier time than was saved in these data files.
(<a href="http://code.google.com/p/fds-smv/issues/detail?id=317&can=1&sort=-id">Issue 317</a>).
<li>fix - fix drawing of text on the colorbar 
(<a href="http://code.google.com/p/fds-smv/issues/detail?id=325&can=1&sort=-id">Issue 325</a>).
</ol>
<li>5.1.3 (build 1501) - March 26, 2008
<ol>
<li>enhancement -  redo grid show menu to make clearer which grid planes will be visible once grid drawing is turned on.  
(<a href="http://code.google.com/p/fds-smv/issues/detail?id=308&can=1&sort=-id">Issue 308</a>)
<li>fix - fix data chopping (<a href="http://code.google.com/p/fds-smv/issues/detail?id=303&can=1&sort=-id">Issue 303</a>).
