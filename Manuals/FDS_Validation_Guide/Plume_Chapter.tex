\chapter{Fire Plumes}

For FDS simulations involving buoyant plumes, a measure of how well the flow field is resolved is given by the
non-dimensional expression $D^*/\dx$, where $D^*$ is a characteristic
fire diameter
\be D^* = \left(
     \frac{\dQ}{\rho_\infty \, c_p \, T_\infty \, \sqrt{g} }
     \right)^\frac{2}{5}  \ee
and $\dx$ is the nominal size of a mesh cell\footnote{The characteristic
fire diameter is related to the characteristic fire size via the
relation $Q^* = (D^*/D)^{5/2}$, where $D$ is the physical diameter of the
fire.}. The quantity $D^*/\dx$ can be thought of as the number of computational cells
spanning the characteristic (not necessarily the physical) diameter of the fire.
The more cells spanning the fire, the better the resolution of the
calculation. It is better to assess the quality of the mesh in terms
of this non-dimensional parameter, rather than an absolute mesh cell size.
For example, a cell size of 10~cm may be ``adequate,'' in some sense,
for evaluating the spread of smoke and heat through a building from a
sizable fire, but may not be appropriate to study a very small, smoldering source.



\section{McCaffrey's Plume Correlation}

The following pages show the results of simulations of McCaffrey's five fires with a grid resolution
such that $D^*/\dx=10$. The mesh cells were all cubes, and no stretching was used.

\section{Heskestad's Flame Height Correlation}

A widely used experimental correlation for flame height is given by the expression~\cite{SFPE:Heskestad}:
\be \frac{L_f}{D} = 3.7 \; (Q^*)^{2/5} - 1.02 \ee
where
\be Q^* = \frac{\dQ}{\rho_\infty \, c_p \, T_\infty \, \sqrt{g} \; D^{5/2} }  \ee
is a non-dimensional quantity that relates the fire's heat release rate, $\dQ$, with the diameter of its base, $D$. The greater the value of $Q^*$, the
higher the flame height relative to its base diameter. Table~\ref{Flame_Height_Parameters} lists the parameters for 16 FDS calculations of a fire in a 1~m by 1~m
square pan\footnote{The effective diameter, $D$, of a 1~m square pan is 1.13~m, obtained by equating the area of a square and circle.},
and Fig.~\ref{Flame_Height} compares the FDS predictions with Heskestad's empirical correlation. Note that the flame height for the FDS
simulations is defined as the distance above the pan, on average, at which 99~\% of the fuel has been consumed. Note also that the simulations were
run at three different grid resolutions. A convenient length scale is given by
\be D^* = (Q^*)^{2/5} \, D \ee
Given a grid cell size, $\dx$, the three resolutions can be characterized by the non-dimensional quantity, $D^*/\dx$, whose values in this case are 5, 10 and 20.

\section{VTT Large Hall and FM/SNL Test Series}

\label{VTT_plume}

Plume temperature measurements are available from the VTT Large Hall and the FM/SNL series.
For all the other full-scale experiments, the temperature above the fire has not been reported, or the fire plume
leans because of the flow pattern within the compartment, or the fire is positioned against a wall.
Only for the VTT and the FM/SNL series are the plumes relatively free from perturbations.

The VTT experiments consist of liquid fuel pan fires positioned in the middle of a large fire test hall.
Plume temperatures are measured at two heights above the fire, 6~m and 12~m.
The flames were observed to extend to about 4~m above the fire pan.


%Photographs from the VTT tests are available. It is difficult to precisely measure the flame height,
%but the photos and videos allow one to make estimates accurate to within a pan diameter.
%Similarly, flame height in FDS is assessed using the visualization program Smokeview.
%There are various ways to render the fire in Smokeview.  The
%most direct method is to show, via three dimensional surface plots, the volume within which the energy from the fire is being released.
%The other method is to show the stoichiometric iso-surface of the mixture fraction.
%FDS tracks the fuel and oxygen via a single scalar variable called the mixture fraction.
%The stoichiometric iso-surface is essentially a sheet on which combustion occurs.  The average vertical extent of either the volume
%in which energy is being released or the stoichiometric mixture fraction iso-surface is the FDS predicted flame height.
%Shown in Figure~\ref{FDS_Flame} are snapshots from the simulation of the 1.6 m diameter heptane pan fire.
%The pan has been approximated as a square because of the requirement by FDS of rectangular geometry.
%Figure~\ref{Simo_Photos} contains photographs of the actual fire.
%The height of the visible flame in the photographs has been estimated to be between 2.4 and 3 pan diameters (3.8 m to 4.8 m).
%The height of the simulated fire fluctuates from 5 m to 6 m during the peak heat release rate phase.


In the FM/SNL experiments, in Tests 4 and 5, thermocouples were positioned near the ceiling directly over the fire pan.
In Test 21, the fire was positioned within an empty electrical cabinet, and the closest near ceiling thermocouple
was used to assess the plume temperature prediction.

Comparisons of the predicted and measured plume temperatures for the VTT and FM/SNL tests are found on the following pages, including a
summary plot at the end of the chapter.

\section{Sandia 1 m Helium Plume}
\label{Sandia plume}

Calculations of the Sandia 1 m helium plume are run at three grid resolutions: 6 cm, 3 cm, and 1.5 cm.  To give the reader with a qualitative feel for the results, Fig.~\ref{Sandia_He_1m_image} provides a snapshot of density contours from the simulation. The calculations are run in parallel on 16 processors; the outlined blocks indicate the domain decomposition.  Data for vertical velocity, radial velocity, and helium mass fraction are recorded at three levels downstream from the base of the plume, $z = [0.2, 0.4, 0.6]$ m, corresponding to the experimental measurements of O'Hern et al.~\cite{OHern:2005}.  Results for the mean profiles are given in Figs.~\ref{Sandia_He_1m_velocity} and \ref{Sandia_He_1m_massfraction}.  The means are taken between $t=10$ and $t=20$ seconds in the simulation.

The domain is 3 m $\times$ 3 m $\times$ 4 m. The boundary conditions are open on all sides with a smooth solid surface surrounding the 1 m diameter helium pool.  The ambient and helium mixture temperature is set to 12 $^\circ$C and the background pressure is set to 80900 Pa to correspond to the experimental conditions.  The helium/acetone/oxygen mixture molecular weight is set to 5.45 kg/kmol.  The turbulent Schmidt and Prandtl numbers are left at the FDS default value of 0.5.  The helium mixture mass flux is specified as 0.0605 kg/s/m$^2$.  One noteworthy difference between this calculation and previous work modeling the Sandia helium plume \cite{DesJardin:2004} is that here the pool is depressed by 6 cm (one cell thickness for the coarsest case) which allows for variation in the inlet velocity profile at the $z=0$ m plane, the plume baseline.  This modification is justified based on the $\pm 6$ \% flow variation reported in \cite{Blanchat:2001} and is significant to the results.  Further, the variation reported in \cite{Blanchat:2001} was based on hot wire probe measurements with air flowing through the honeycomb flow straighteners at the plume source.  The variation might be greater for helium flows due to the buoyant accelerations which were not present in the air/air test case (S. Tieszen, personal communication).

\section{Sandia 1 m Methane Pool Fire}
\label{Sandia_methane}

The Sandia 1 m methane pool fire series provides data for three methane flow rates: Test 14 (low flow rate), Test 24 (medium flow rate), and Test 17 (high flow rate) \cite{Tieszen:2004}.  The experiments are simulated using three grid resolutions: 6 cm, 3 cm, and 1.5 cm.  Fig.~\ref{Sandia_CH4_1m_image} provides a snapshot of temperature contours from the 1.5 cm Test 17 simulation. The calculations are run in parallel on 16 processors: a similar computational set up as the helium case (the experiments were run in the same facility at Sandia).  Data for vertical velocity and radial velocity are recorded at three levels downstream from the base of the plume, $z = [0.3, 0.5, 0.9]$ m.  Results for the mean profiles are given in Figs.~\ref{Sandia_CH4_1m_Test14_velocity} - \ref{Sandia_CH4_1m_Test17_velocity}.  The means are taken between $t=10$ and $t=20$ seconds in the simulation.

For Test 17, we recorded the vertical velocity as a time series in four locations in the plume, at two positions along the centerline and at two positions on the edge.  The time series from our 1.5 cm simulation at $x=0$ m and $z=0.5$ m, corresponding to Fig.~6 in \cite{Tieszen:2002}, is shown in Fig.~\ref{Sandia_CH4_1m_Test17_spectrum} along with the power spectrum from the average of the four time series locations.  The eddy dissipation constant in the turbulent combustion model is tuned to a value of $C = 0.1$ based on comparison of the simulated large scale puffing mode with the experimentally obtained value of 1.65 Hz \cite{Tieszen:2002}.

\section{Sandia 1 m Hydrogen Pool Fire}
\label{Sandia_hydrogen}

Sandia Test 35 \cite{Tieszen:2004} is simulated at three grid resolutions: 6 cm, 3 cm, and 1.5 cm.  The computational set up is nearly identical to the methane cases.  Results for mean vertical and radial velocity are given in Figs.~\ref{Sandia_H2_1m_Test35_velocity}.  Means are taken from a time average between $t=10$ and $t=20$ seconds in the simulation.

By examining movies of the simulation results we can see a qualitative difference between the methane and hydrogen cases.  The dynamics of the hydrogen case tend to dominated by near total consumption events which create blowback on the pool followed by streaks of accelerating buoyant flow which increase the mean vertical velocity.  An example of the consumption event is seen near the end of the case shown in Fig.~\ref{Sandia_H2_1m_image}.  It is possible that we have not run the simulation long enough for accurate statistics and that streaking events early in the time window (between 10-20 seconds) are biasing the mean vertical velocity to be too high, as is clear from the top-left plot in Fig.~\ref{Sandia_H2_1m_Test35_velocity}.
