&HEAD CHID='box_burn_away4', TITLE='Test BURN_AWAY feature' / 

The FOAM box is evaporated away by the high thermal radiation
from HOT surfaces. The mass of the box is 0.4^3 m3 * 20 kg/m3 = 1.28 kg.
However, the ratio of heats of combustion between the material and 
gas phase reaction is 30000/40000 = 0.75. The total released mass should 
be 0.75 * 1.28 kg = 0.96 kg. This should be compared to the final value of fuel density volume integral,  computed by the first DEVC.

The gas species here is mixture fraction fuel, burning rate specified.
