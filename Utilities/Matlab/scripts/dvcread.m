% Read a _devc.csv file for V&V processing.  The idea is to create the
% basic equivalent of csvread, except that we need also to read the header
% lines.  In principle, xlsread should handle this but we have experienced
% problems with this function.  Actually, the file given by 'filename' does
% not have to be a devc file.  But we take advantage of the fact that after
% the header lines have been read, the remaining data is numeric and 
% comma-delimited, so that we may use csvread at that point.  We also
% assume that the header names are contained in the last successfully read
% text line, since in devc files the units are typically given by the first
% line of text.
