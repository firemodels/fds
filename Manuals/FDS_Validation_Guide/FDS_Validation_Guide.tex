\chapter{Preface}

This is Volume 3 of the FDS Technical Reference Guide. Volume 1 describes the mathematical model and numerical method. Volume 2 documents past and
present model verification work. Instructions for using FDS are contained in a separate User's Guide~\cite{FDS_Users_Guide}.

The FDS Technical Reference Guide is based in part on the ``Standard Guide for Evaluating the Predictive Capability of
Deterministic Fire Models,'' ASTM~E~1355~\cite{ASTM:E1355}. ASTM~E~1355 defines {\em model evaluation} as ``the process of quantifying the accuracy
of chosen results from a model when applied for a specific use.'' The model evaluation process consists of two main components: verification and
validation. {\em Verification} is a process to check the correctness of the solution of the governing equations. Verification does not imply that the
governing equations are appropriate; only that the equations are being solved correctly. {\em Validation} is a process to determine the
appropriateness of the governing equations as a mathematical model of the physical phenomena of interest. Typically, validation involves comparing
model results with experimental measurement. Differences that cannot be explained in terms of numerical errors in the model or uncertainty in the
measurements are attributed to the assumptions and simplifications of the physical model.

Evaluation is critical to establishing both the acceptable uses and limitations of a model. Throughout its development, FDS has undergone various
forms of evaluation, both at NIST and beyond. This volume provides a survey of validation work conducted to date to evaluate FDS.

\item Jianping Zhang at the University of Ulster contributed heat flux measurements from the SBI apparatus.
\item At the University of Maryland, Professor Fred~Mowrer and Phil Friday were the first to apply FDS to the NRC-sponsored experiments referred to in this document as the ``FM/SNL Test Series'' (Factory Mutual and Sandia National Laboratories conducted these experiments).
\item Jukka Vaari of VTT, Finland, contributed the Cup Burner test cases.
\item Steve Nowlen of Sandia National Laboratory provided valuable information about the FM/SNL series, and he also conducted the CAROLFIRE experiments.
\item Ulf Wickstr\"{o}m of SP, Sweden, contributed experimental data from a series of experiments (SP AST) that were designed to evaluate the feasibility of using plate thermometer measurements as boundary conditions for a heat conduction calculation within several types of steel beams. The adiabatic surface temperature concept was tested in both the experiments and model.
\item Jeremy Thornock at the University of Utah provided data on the Sandia helium plume.
\item Sheldon Teiszen at Sandia National Laboratories, Albuquerque, provided detailed statistics for the helium plume and pool fire experiments conducted in the Sandia FLAME facility.
\item Taylor Myers, a student at the University of Maryland and a Summer Undergraduate Research Fellow (SURF) at NIST, analyzed the Vettori Flat and Sloped Ceiling sprinkler experiments. Thanks also to Bob Vettori of the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission and formerly of NIST for his help in locating the original test data and laboratory notebooks.
\item Hans la Cour-Harbo, a masters degree student at the Technical University of Denmark, provided guidance and insight on the NRCC Facade experiments. Scott Bareham of NIST provided the technical drawing of the test enclosure.
\item Prof.~Stanislav Stoliarov and graduate students Mark McKinnon and Jing Li of the University of Maryland provided the properties of several polymers for the FAA Polymers example.
\item Michael Spearpoint and masters degree students Roger Harrison and Rob Fleury of the University of Canterbury, New Zealand, supplied measurements of mass entrainment rates into spill plumes (Harrison Spill Plumes) and heat flux measurements from propane burner fires (Fleury Heat Flux).
\item Ezti Oztekin of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) developed the FAA Cargo Compartments cases based on experiments sponsored by the FAA.

\chapter{Conclusion}



\section{Summary of FDS Model Uncertainty Statistics}


Table~\ref{summary_stats} lists the summary statistics for the different quantities examined in this Guide. This is, for each quantity of interest, Table~\ref{summary_stats} lists the bias and relative standard deviation of the predicted values. It also lists the total number of experimental data sets on which these statistics are based, as well as the total number of point to point comparisons. Obviously, the more data sets and the more points, the more reliable the statistics.

\section{Normality Tests}
\label{normality_tests}

The plots on the following pages display histograms of the quantity $\ln(M/E)$. Recall from Chapter~\ref{Error_Chapter} that it has been assumed that the uncertainties of the measured, $E_i$, and predicted, $M_i$, quantities are normally distributed, and, thus, that the quantity $\ln(M/E)$ is normally distributed. To test this assumption for each of the quantities of interest listed in Table~\ref{summary_stats}, Spiegelhalter's normality test has been applied~\cite{Spiegelhalter:Biometrika1983}. This test examines a set of values, $x_1,...,x_n$ whose mean and standard deviation are computed as follows:
\be
   \bar{x} = \sum_{i=1}^n x_i  \quad ; \quad \sigma^2 = \frac{1}{n-1}  \sum_{i=1}^n \left( x_i - \bar{x} \right)^2
\ee
Spiegelhalter tests the null hypothesis that the sample $x_i$ is taken from a normally distributed population. The test statistic is
\be
   {\rm S} = \frac{N-0.73 \, n}{0.9 \, \sqrt{n}}  \quad ; \quad N=\sum_{i=1}^n Z_i^2 \, \ln \, Z_i^2  \quad ; \quad Z_i = \frac{x_i - \bar{x}}{\sigma}
\ee
Under the null hypothesis, the test statistic is normally distributed with mean 0 and standard deviation of 1. If the $p$-value
\be
   p = 1 - \left| \erf \left( \frac{{\rm S}}{\sqrt{2}} \right) \right|
\ee
is less than 0.05, the null hypothesis is rejected.
