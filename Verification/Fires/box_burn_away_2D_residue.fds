&HEAD CHID='box_burn_away_2D_residue', TITLE='Test BURN_AWAY feature' / 

The FOAM box is evaporated away by the high thermal radiation
from HOT surfaces. The mass of the box is 1 * 0.4^2 m3 * 20 kg/m3 = 3.2 kg.
Half of the mass is converted to fuel and other half to residue.
Bulk density defines the combustible mass of the box:
     10 kg/m3 x 0.16 m3 = 1.6 kg.
This should be compared to the final value of fuel density volume integral, 
computed by the first DEVC.

The gas species is mixture fraction fuel.
