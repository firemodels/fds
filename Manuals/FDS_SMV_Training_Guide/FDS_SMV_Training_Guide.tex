\chapter{Preface}

This Guide contains a description of experiments and corresponding numerical simulations performed in
facilities used  to train fire fighters.  It also contains descriptions of demonstration
numerical simulations designed to illustrate fundamental fire phenomena encountered while
fighting fire, phenomena such as how smoke layers behave in the presense or absence of
door openings.  These simulations are performed by the Fire Dynamics Simulator (FDS)
and visualized  by the visualization program, Smokeview.

Note that this Guide does not provide the background theory for FDS nor a detailed description of Smokeview. The FDS
Technical Reference Guide~\cite{FDS_Tech_Guide_5} contains details about the governing
equations and numerical methods. The FDS User's Guide~\cite{FDS_Users_Guide_5} describes how to run FDS. Smokeview is described in the ``User's Guide for
Smokeview Version~5''~\cite{Smokeview_Users_Guide_5}.

\chapter{Introduction}
The most effective method for learning how to fight fire is to fight fire.  This however is expensive and
particularly dangerous for the trainee.   In particular, some fire situations that must be trained for are too
large and dangerous to re-create in a training setting involving real fires.  Environmental concerns are
limiting the amount and kind of live fire training available in many areas of the country.  Methods are then
needed to allow fire fighters to gain valuable experience using virtual reality techniques already applied in
other fields so that they may learn without the possibility of harming themselves or others.  It is a challenge
to simulate fire fighter training scenarios that are accurate and to present them in a form that are realistic
and practical due to the large amounts of computational resources required.   Presently, fire fighter trainers
either concentrate on incident command issues or depend on an {\em expert}\ to alter the fire.
The trainer developed
here will be Physics based so that the fire and smoke visualized will be closer to what one would expect to find
when fighting real fires.

Presently, fire fighters train in the classroom and in live fire training using real fires in real
facilities.  Visual based training presently relies on experts to run the fire and are not physics based.
This project will continue to develop a computer based fire fighting training tool to improve training
opportunities while lowering the cost and risk of death and injury.   Two methods are being used to create a
training tool.   The first and simpler method  is to use FDS and Smokeview to create animations of fire
scenarios.  These animations will be viewable in a standard DVD player.  The DVD menus will be used to walk a
fire fighter through a series of decisions.  The second method will be more interactive.  Using Smokeview,
the trainee will {\em walk}\ through an FDS generated fire scene observing and making decisions.  Several  scenarios
will be simulated with FDS.  These scenarios involve cases where experimental data is available; the Maryland
Fire Research Institute's (MFRI) training tower and the Montgomery County's flashover trainer.  In subsequent
years, more generic scenarios will be modeled; a ranch house (one level) and a townhouse
(multi-level).

NIST is uniquely positioned to apply research to this problem that it developed for modeling fire and smoke
movement.  The fire science software tools, NIST FDS and Smokeview will be used as a basis for developing a
virtual reality based fire fighting training tool.  As a fire simulation unfolds a series of natural break point
will be encountered where the trainee will be asked questions such as: Should the window be opened?  Should the
door be closed? Should the hose stream be opened?  The simulation will continue based on the answers provided.
These questions will be designed to teach the trainee about tactics relevant to fire fighting such as the
effect ventilation on fire spread.    Since FDS cannot yet perform calculations in real time, simulations
will be pre-computed for all possible question outcomes.  Smokeview will be enhanced to be able to {\em jump}
from one scenario to another according to the trainee's responses.

\section{Numerical Fire Fighting Training Tools}
Two software tools are used to generate the Physics based fire fighter training scenarios
described in this document.  The first tool is the Fire Dynamics Simulator (FDS).
It is used to perform numerical simulations using established Physics based algorithms.
It is a computational
fluid dynamics or CFD model of fire-driven fluid flow. FDS solves a form of the
Navier-Stokes equations appropriate for low-speed, thermally-driven flow
with an emphasis on smoke and heat transport from fires.
These approximations allow the computations to be performed both accurately and efficiently.

The second tool is called Smokeview.  It is used to visualize or interpret the data
simulated by FDS.  Smokeview {\em translates}\ data simulated by FDS into
various types of moving or animated images.  These images range in complexity from simple tracer particles,
to 2D shaded contours, 3D level surfaces and finally realistic looking smoke and fire.  These visualizations use
algorithms known as Beer's law that associate computed soot density with optical opacity.  They are also Physics based.  It cannot be emphasized enough
that displayed images are not cartoons, they are drawn based on numerical results generated by the fire model FDS.

\section{Overview}
This publication documents a series of FDS test cases used as a basis for fire fighter training.
These test cases fall into two logical groups, those that are based on a full scale experiments and those that are meant to be demonstrations of fire phenomena encountered by fire fighters.

The FDS scenarios that are experimentally based are documented by 1) briefly describing the experiment with references to a more complete description, 2) briefly describing the numerical modeling that was performed giving the relevant input files and 3) giving a comparison of some of the experimental data collected with the corresponding numerical results.
