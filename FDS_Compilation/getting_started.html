<h2>Getting Started using FDS/Smokeview Build Scripts</h2>
<a href="Scripts/EDIT_getting_started.bat">Edit this web page</a>
<hr size="1">

<p><strong>Warning: The <em>Edit this web page</em> link above will not work 
until the <tt>fds_smv_env.bat</tt> setup script is configured by specifying repository locations, 
user names <em>etc</em>.</strong>

<h3>Initial Setup</h3>

<ul>
<li>Setting up environment defintions
<ol>
<li><strong>Copy <tt>fds_smv_env.bat</tt> to your home directory</strong> - Do this by
opening up the <tt>FDS_Compilation\Scripts</tt> folder and double-clicking on the <tt>COPY_fds_smv_env.bat</tt> batch file. 
<li><a href="Scripts/EDIT_fds_smv_env_firsttime.bat"><strong>Customize <tt>fds_smv_env.bat</tt></strong></a> - Define keyword values for your own setup by editing values in <tt>fds_smv_env.bat</tt>.<br>
 Note: this only needs to be done once.  Example:
<blockquote>
set svn_root=d:\fds-smv<br>
set svn_drive=d:<br>
set linux_svn_root=FDS-SMV<br>
set linux_username=gforney<br>
set google_username=gforney<br>
set linux_hostname=acrux.cfr.nist.gov<br>
</blockquote>
<p>Note: other edits will be made when you start building FDS or Smokeview (specifying version strings, revision numbers etc).
</ol>
<p><li>Compilers
<ol>
<li>Install Intel Fortran and (optionally) C/C++ compilers - version 11
<li>Copy the compiler environmental setup scripts into <tt>c:\bin</tt>.  (Create <tt>c:\bin</tt> if it doesn't exist already.)
<ol>
<li>Intel Fortran: copy <tt>ifortvars.bat</tt> from the
Intel compiler bin directories to <tt>c:\bin</tt>
<li>Intel C/C++: copy <tt>iclvars.bat</tt> from the
Intel compiler bin directories to <tt>c:\bin</tt> .  
Note this step is only necessary if you build Smokeview using these scripts.  In that case, you MUST also install the Intel C/C++ compilers.
<li>Visual Studio C/C++: Open up the <tt>FDS_Compilation/Scripts</tt> directory and double click on the <tt>COPY_clvars.bat</tt> batch file.
This will copy <tt>clvars.bat</tt> from the repository to <tt>c:\bin</tt>.
<p><a href="Scripts/EDIT_clvars.bat"</a>Edit <tt>clvars.bat</tt></a> to make sure the path specified in this batch file
matches your distribution of Visual Studio.
</ol>
</ol>
<p><li>Putty
<ol>
<li>Install putty.  Doesn't matter where - just make sure the install directory is in the <em>path</em> .<br> 
Test the installation by opening up a command shell and typing <tt>plink</tt> at the command line. 
<li>Set up ssh keys to let you login into the Linux cluster without a password.  Basically you are creating a public/private pair 
of ssh keys.  You copy the private key to somewhere on your PC (doesn't matter where) 
and copy the public key into a file on the Linux cluster.  More precisely:
<ol>
<li>run puttygen
<li>click on the <tt>SSH-2 RSA</tt> radio button
<li>click on the <tt>Generate</tt> button.  Pick a <em>pass-phrase</em> that you can easily remember.
<li>Save the private key into the <tt>c:\bin\keys</tt> directory (create the directory it if it doesn't already exist)
<li>Save the public key and copy it to the Linux cluster.  Put the key at the end of the file <tt>authorized_key2</tt> which
is located in the <tt>.ssh</tt> directory (in your home directory)
</ol>
<li>On your PC, copy the file <tt>Pageant.exe</tt> to <tt>C:\Documents and Settings\gforney\Start Menu\Programs\Startup</tt> 
(change <tt>gforney</tt> to your user name).  
<li>Reboot your computer.
<li>Open <tt>Pageant</tt> (an icon looking like looking like a terminal wearing a black hat should 
appear in the right side of the task bar).
This program will direct you to open your private key and ask you for the pass-phrase used to create it. 
</ol>
<p><li>Uploading files to googlecode with Python
<p><a href="http://www.python.org/">Download and install Python</a>
<p><li>Google password file
<p>Create a file named <tt>gc.passwd</tt> containing your google password and put it in your windows home directory.
<p><li>Winzip
<ol>
<li>Install Winzip version 12, Winzip command line tool and Winzip self extractor.  
Note, The Winzip command line tool is free but is a separate download from Winzip 12.  
The Winzip self extractor needs to be purchased separately.
<li>Put winzip tools in <tt>c:\bin\winzip</tt>
</ol>
</ul>

<h3>Using the Scripts</h3>
After the environment has been defined and the necessary software has been installed, the script pages below may be used to build
FDS, Smokeview or other components (presently just the Verification cases).
