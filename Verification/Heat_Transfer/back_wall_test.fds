Create a steel box with 1 m sides. Add a hot inner box 0.8 m on a side centered inside the box, and then record 
external temperatures of the box sides that are zero or one cell thick. It should not matter whether the sides are zero
or one cell thick -- the heat conduction should be the same because the steel is 0.5 cm thick on all sides.
Note that the sides of the box coincide with mesh boundaries. This tests the ability of the code to transfer heat across mesh
boundaries within a solid. For simplicity there is no convective heat transfer, emissivities are all 1, and the background
gas is nitrogen. The heat transfer is purely radiative in the gas phase and conductive through the solid walls.
