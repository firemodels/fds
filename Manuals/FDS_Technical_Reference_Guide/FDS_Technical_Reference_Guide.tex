\chapter{Preface}

This document
provides the theoretical basis for the Fire Dynamics Simulator (FDS), following the general framework set forth in
the ``Standard Guide for
Evaluating the Predictive Capability of Deterministic Fire Models,'' ASTM~E~1355~\cite{ASTM:E1355}.
It is the first of a four volume set of companion documents, referred to
collectively as the FDS Technical Reference Guide~\cite{FDS_Tech_Guide}. Volumes 2, 3 and 4 describe the model
verification, experimental validation, and configuration management, respectively.

A separate document, {\em Fire Dynamics Simulator, User's Guide}~\cite{FDS_Users_Guide} describes how the FDS software is
actually used.


\chapter{Disclaimer}

The US Department of Commerce makes no warranty, expressed or implied,
to users of the Fire Dynamics Simulator (FDS), and accepts no responsibility for its use.
Users of FDS assume sole responsibility under Federal law for determining
the appropriateness of its use in any particular application;
for any conclusions drawn from the results of its use; and for any
actions taken or not taken as a result of analysis performed using these tools.

Users are warned that FDS is intended for use only by those competent
in the fields of fluid dynamics, thermodynamics, heat transfer, combustion, and fire science,
and is intended only to supplement the informed judgment of the qualified user.
The software package is a computer model that may or may not have predictive
capability when applied to a specific set of factual circumstances.
Lack of accurate predictions by the model could lead to erroneous
conclusions with regard to fire safety. All results should be evaluated by an informed user.

Throughout this document, the mention of computer hardware or commercial
software does not constitute endorsement by NIST, nor does it indicate that
the products are necessarily those best suited for the intended purpose.


\chapter{Acknowledgments}

\label{acksection}

The development and maintenance of the Fire Dynamics Simulator has been made possible through
a partnership of public and private organizations, both in the United States and abroad. Following
is a list of contributors from the various sectors of the fire research, fire protection engineering and
fire services communities:

FDS is supported financially via internal funding at both NIST and VTT, Finland. In addition, support has been provided by the following:
\begin{itemize}
\item The US Nuclear Regulatory Commission Office of Research has funded key validation experiments, the preparation of the FDS manuals, and the development of various sub-models that are of importance in the area of nuclear power plant safety. Special thanks to Mark Salley, Jason Dreisbach, and David Stroup for their efforts and support.
\item The US Forest Service has supported the development of sub-models in FDS designed to simulate the spread of fire in the Wildland Urban Interface (WUI). Special thanks to Mark Finney and Tony Bova for their support.
\item The Minerals Management Service of the US Department of the Interior funded research at NIST aimed at characterizing the burning behavior of oil spilled on the open sea or ice. Part of this research led to the development of the ALOFT (A Large Outdoor Fire plume Trajectory) model, a forerunner of FDS. Special thanks to Joe Mullin for his encouragement of the modeling efforts.
\end{itemize}
\noindent At VTT, the FDS development has been supported by
\begin{itemize}
\item The Finnish Funding Agency for Technology and Innovation (TEKES) has supported the development of fire and evacuation simulation capabilities.
\item The Finnish State Nuclear Waste Management Fund (VYR) under the national research programmes on nuclear safety.
\item The European Union through the FP6 and FP7 research projects FIRE PARADOX, TRANSFEU and FIRE-RESIST.
\end{itemize}
The following individuals and organizations played a role in the development of the underlying mathematical model of FDS.
\begin{itemize}
\item Originally, the basic hydrodynamic solver was designed by Ronald Rehm and Howard Baum with programming help from Darcy Barnett, Dan Lozier and Hai Tang of the Computing and Applied Mathematics Laboratory at NIST, and Dan Corley of the Building and Fire Research Laboratory (BFRL). Jim Sims of CAML developed the original visualization software.
\item The direct Poisson solver (CRAYFISKPAK) was written by Roland Sweet of the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR), Boulder, Colorado.
\item Kuldeep Prasad added the multiple-mesh data structures, paving the way for parallel processing.
\item Charles Bouldin devised the basic framework of the parallel version of the code.
\item William Grosshandler (retired from NIST) and Tom Cleary (currently at NIST) developed an enhancement to the smoke detector activation algorithm, originally conceived by Gunnar Heskestad of Factory Mutual.
\item Steve Olenick of Combustion Science and Engineering (CSE) implemented the smoke detector model into FDS.
\item William Grosshandler is also the developer of RadCal, a library of subroutines that have been incorporated in FDS to provide the radiative properties of gases and smoke.
\item Professor Fred Mowrer, formerly of the University of Maryland, provided a simple model of gas phase extinction to FDS.
\item Ezgi S. Oztekin of the Fire Research Program at William J. Hughes Technical Center together with Kiyoung Moon and Jung-il Choi of Yonsei University in Seoul, South Korea, developed the log law model for convective heat transfer.
\item The authors would like thank Sean Smith of the University of Utah for insightful discussions on the turbulent combustion model.
