\chapter{Burning Rate}

This chapter contains a series of validation exercises where the aim is to {\em predict} the burning rate of the fuel. Most of the simulations included in the previous chapters involved
a {\em specified} burning or heat release rate. Here, the objective is to apply measured thermophysical properties of the material and predict its burning rate, either with a
specified heat flux or as a free burn.



\section{FAA Polymers}\label{sec_FAA_Polymers}

The U.S.~Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has studied various plastics that are commonly used aboard commercial aircraft.

This section presents measured properties of various polymers and the numerical predictions of their mass loss and/or burning rates under constant heat heating.
Two types of experiments are considered. First, the NIST Gasification Apparatus is used to measure the mass loss rate of non-burning samples in a nitrogen atmosphere.
Second, the standard Cone Calorimeter~\cite{conecal} is used to measure the heat release rate of materials in a normal atmosphere.
When just the mass loss rate of a non-burning sample has been measured, FDS is run in ``solid phase only'' mode; that is, a 1-D heat conduction calculation is performed in a
single grid cell. The result is the predicted mass loss rate as a function of time. To simulate a cone calorimeter experiment, FDS simulates the burning of a 10~cm by 10~cm sample with
a specified heat flux to represent the effect of the cone heater. The cone itself is not included in the simulation. As the sample burns, FDS predicts the additional radiative and
convective heating of the sample as a result of the fire.

In general, the burning/gasification rate of a charring polymer is more difficult to predict than a non-charring one because there are more parameters that need to be measured and
more complicated behavior, like intumescence, need to be considered.

\subsection{Glossary of Terms}
\label{glossary}

\begin{description}
\item[Assumption:]  Characteristics were assumed from known properties in similar materials.
\item[Cone Calorimeter] (ASTM E 1354 \cite{conecal}) The Cone Calorimeter exposes a small sample to a constant external radiant heat flux simulating exposure of the sample to a large scale fire. The device records mass loss data along with heat release data through oxygen consumption calorimetry. From this a variety of heat release related properties can be found including heat of combustion.
\item[Constant Volume:] The material is assumed to maintain a constant volume during the solid phase reactions.
\item[Direct:]  Direct measurement of densities is performed by measuring the dimensions and mass of the sample.
\item[DSC:] (ASTM E 2070 \cite{diffscancal}) A Differential Scanning Calorimeter precisely raises the temperature of a small sample of material at a constant rate. This coupled with knowledge of heat absorbed by the sample allows for the calculation of the specific heat function of a material as well as heats of reaction and phase change.
\item[Estimated:] Characteristics were approximated based on known properties in similar materials.
\item[FTIR:] Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy uses a spectrometer to simultaneously characterize the absorption of all frequencies of infrared light. In testing a sample is exposed to infrared light and a detector records light that has passed through the sample. A Fourier transform of detector measurement is then translated into absorption information.
\item[Gasification Apparatus:] Similar to the Cone Calorimeter however flaming is prevented. This is done typically through the introduction of inert purge gases.
\item[Inherited:] The properties of the product or component are assumed to be the same as the original material.
\item[Inverse Analysis:] Property was established by fitting a model to measured temperatures from the Cone Calorimeter or Gasification Apparatus.
\item[IS:] (ASTM E 1175 \cite{intgsphere}) An Integrating Sphere, or an Ulbricht Sphere, is a hollow cavity whose interior has a high diffuse reflectivity. A sample placed inside the sphere is exposed to incident radiation and reflectivity measured. Emissivity can be determined from this information. The standard above is for measurement of Solar reflectivity, and was not necessarily precisely followed.
\item[Laser Flash:] (ASTM E1461 \cite{laserflash}) In the Laser Flash Method one surface of a sample is rapidly heated using a single pulse from a laser. Heat sensors on the opposite side of the sample record the arrival of the resulting temperature disturbance. From this thermal diffusivity/thermal conductivity can be calculated.
\item[Literature:] Results were found within previously published literature.
\item[MCC:] (ASTM D 7309 \cite{microcc}) The Microscale Combustion Calorimeter (MCC)  rapidly pyrolyzes a milligram size sample in an inert atmosphere. The pyrolyzate is then exposed to an abundance of oxygen.  Heat release history is obtained from oxygen consumption. Similar to TGA with  heat release recorded rather than mass loss rate.
\item[Pulsed Current:] Can refer to different types of tests. Generally, a sample is positioned between two electrodes in a sealed chamber with an inert atmosphere. The sample is heated through pulses of current. Measurements of the sample and the chamber can give information regarding specific heat, emissivity, or other material properties.
\item[TGA:] (ASTM E 1131 \cite{thermalga}) In Thermal Gravimetric Analysis (TGA)  a small sample is heated at uniform rate, generally in an Nitrogen (N$_2$) atmosphere. The percentage weight loss of the sample is recorded relative to the sample's temperature. Rate constants can then be fitted to the data. Similar to MCC with mass loss recorded instead of heat release.
\item[TLS:] (ASTM D 5930 \cite{transline}) The Transient Line Source method records temperature of a single point at a fixed distance in a sample over time using a probe. Given knowledge of the heat exposure of the sample the thermal conductivity can be found from the slope of the recorded data.

\subsection{Non-Charring Polymers, HDPE, HIPS, and PMMA}

A non-charring polymer is considered one of the easier solids to model because it typically involves only a single, first order reaction that converts solid plastic to fuel vapor.
No residue is formed and the plastic is completely pyrolyzed. Table~\ref{FAA_Properties}
lists nine parameters for each polymer studied. These values have been input directly into FDS, and the predicted mass loss rates are compared with measured values from the NIST
Gasification Apparatus, a device that pyrolyzes the solid in a nitrogen environment to prevent combustion of fuel gases. The results are shown in Fig.~\ref{FAA_Polymers}. The exposing
heat flux was 52~kW/m$^2$. A 1~cm layer of insulation was placed under the sample. Its properties are given in Ref.~\cite{Stoliarov:CF2009}.

\subsection{Complex Non-Charring Polymers: PP, PA66, POM, and PET}

The polymers described in this section exhibit slightly more complex behavior than those in the previous section because they exhibit foaming and bubbling as they degrade. Table~\ref{FAA_Properties2} lists the properties of each polymer.  In the model, the polymers melt to form a liquid with identical properties as the solid, and the liquid evaporates. The melting is characterized by a threshold temperature and a heat of reaction equivalent to a heat of melting. These values have been input directly into FDS, and the predicted mass loss rates are compared with measured values from the NIST Gasification Apparatus, a device that pyrolyzes the solid in a nitrogen environment to prevent combustion of fuel gases. The results are shown in Fig.~\ref{FAA_Polymers2}. The exposing heat flux was 50~kW/m$^2$. A thin sheet of aluminum foil and a 2.5~cm layer of Foamglas insulation was placed under the sample. Its properties are given in Ref.~\cite{Stoliarov:FM2012}.

\subsection{Poly(aryl ether ether ketone)) (PEEK)}

Table~\ref{Properties_PEEK} lists the measured properties of poly(aryl ether ether ketone)\footnote{Trade name VICTREX PEEK 450G.
The sample has been thoroughly dried.}. Its property values have been input directly into FDS, and the predicted heat release rates
are compared with measured values from the Cone Calorimeter. It is assumed that the polymer decomposes via a four-step reaction:
\begin{eqnarray}
   \hbox{Polymer} &\to& \hbox{Char 1} + \hbox{Gas 1}  \\
   \hbox{Char 1}  &\to& \hbox{Char 2} + \hbox{Gas 2}  \\
   \hbox{Char 2}  &\to& \hbox{Char 3} + \hbox{Gas 2}  \\
   \hbox{Char 3}  &\to& \hbox{Gas 2}
\end{eqnarray}
It is also assumed that the gaseous fuel molecule is C$_{19}$H$_{12}$O$_3$.
A 1~cm layer of Kaowool insulation was placed under the sample. Its properties are given in Ref.~\cite{Stoliarov:CF2010}.

The results for 3.9~mm samples at imposed heat fluxes of 50~kW/m$^2$, 70~kW/m$^2$, and 90~kW/m$^2$ are shown in Fig.~\ref{HRR_PEEK}. Note that the plots on the left
are the results of simulations of the solid phase only, where the heat feedback from the fire is assumed to be 15~kW/m$^2$ and it is applied at the time of ignition. The
plots on the right are from 3-D simulations of the solid sample and the fire. In these cases, the radiative feedback is not specified but rather calculated.

\subsection{Poly(butylene terephtalate) (PBT)}

Samples of poly(butylene terephtalate) (PBT)\footnote{Tradename Arnite T06-200, DSM Engineering Plastics} have been burned without oxygen in the Gasification Apparatus and
with oxygen in the Cone Calorimeter. The properties of PBT are listed in Table~\ref{Properties_PBT}. It is assumed that the polymer undergoes a single step reaction
that forms fuel gas and no char.

The results of the simulations are shown in Fig.~\ref{HRR_PBT}. Note that the effect of the flame radiation heat feedback to the sample surface is accounted for
by increasing the imposed heat fluxes of 35~kW/m$^2$ by 39~\%, 50~kW/m$^2$ by 22~\%, and 70~kW/m$^2$ by 6~\%~\cite{Kempel:1}.

\subsection{PBT with Glass Fibers (PBT-GF)}

Samples of poly(butylene terephtalate) (PBT), blended with 30~\% by mass glass fibers\footnote{Tradename Arnite TV4-261, DSM Engineering Plastics},
have been burned without oxygen in the Gasification Apparatus and

\section{Corrugated Cardboard}
\label{Cardboard}

Table~\ref{Properties_Cardboard} lists the measured properties of a double-wall corrugated cardboard with the conventional U.S.~designation 69-23B-69-23C-69. Corrugated cardboard is characterized by alternating layers of homogeneous, planar liner boards and corrugated sections made up of periodic flutes. The numbers in the specification indicate the areal density in lb/(1000~ft$^2$) and the letters indicate the flute designation (B indicates a range of 45 to 52 flutes per foot and C indicates a range of 39 to 43 flutes per foot). It is assumed that each layer consists of the same lingo-cellulosic, charring material with the density defined as the mass of the solid material divided by the volume of the layer. This representation requires slightly different definitions for the properties of each unique layer -- liner board (LB), C-flute layer (CFL), and B-flute layer (BFL).

The reaction mechanism for the cardboard material includes one reaction to describe the release of residual moisture and three sequential reactions to describe the thermal degradation of the virgin material to a final residual char. Each of the initial solid components (LB, CFL, and BFL) undergoes the same four-step mechanism.
\begin{eqnarray}
   \hbox{Moisture} &\to& \hbox{Water Vapor}  \\
   \hbox{Virgin Cardboard}  &\to& \hbox{Intermediary Solid} + \hbox{Fuel Gas 2}  \\
   \hbox{Intermediary Solid}  &\to& \hbox{Char 1} + \hbox{Fuel Gas 3}  \\
   \hbox{Char 1}  &\to& \hbox{Char 2} + \hbox{Fuel Gas 4}
\end{eqnarray}

The gasification experiments were conducted in a modified cone calorimeter referred to as the controlled atmosphere pyrolysis apparatus (CAPA)~\cite{Semmes:IAFSS11}, in which the sample is surrounded by nitrogen to prevent ignition. Measured and predicted mass loss rates at imposed heat fluxes of 20~kW/m$^2$, 40~kW/m$^2$, and 60~kW/m$^2$ are shown in Fig.~\ref{MLR_Cardboard}.

\section{Electrical cables (CHRISTIFIRE)}

The U.S.~Nuclear Regulatory Commission has sponsored a study of the burning behavior of electrical cables typically found in nuclear power plants~\cite{CHRISTIFIRE}. The project has been given the acronym CHRISTIFIRE (\underline{C}able \underline{H}eat \underline{R}elease, \underline{I}gnition, and \underline{S}pread in \underline{T}ray \underline{I}nstallations). In this section, the modeling of a particular type of cable is presented. The sample cable (referred to as 701 in the report) has seven conductors and is 14~mm in diameter. The jacket material is polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and the insulation is polyethylene (PE). The mass fractions are 0.24 and 0.18, respectively, and the remaining mass is copper.

Thermo-gravimetric analysis (TGA) with a heating rate of 10~K/min and micro-combustion calorimetry (MCC) with a heating rate of 60~K/min were performed for the jacket and insulation materials separately. Cone calorimeter experiments were performed for sample of seven 10~cm cable segments at exposing heat fluxes of 25~kW/m$^2$, 50~kW/m$^2$, and 75~kW/m$^2$. The experimental methods are explained in Section~\ref{sec_FAA_Polymers}.

\subsection{Estimation of pyrolysis kinetics}

The pyrolysis kinetics were estimated from the TGA results. The kinetic parameters depend on the choice of the reaction path, and for this example two different reaction paths are used. The first one (v1) consists of several parallel, independent reactions that each yield both fuel (combustible) and inert (incombustible) gas. The last reaction also yields residue. The second reaction path (v2) is more complex. For the PVC jacket, the model consists of three components: pure PVC, plasticizer and CaCO$_3$. Pure PVC degrades in two steps, first yielding inert gas and small amounts of fuel gas and residue, and second yielding larger amounts of fuel gas and residue. In air, the residual char is also oxidized, which contributes to the greater mass loss and release of fuel at high temperatures. The plasticizer degrades simultaneously with the first reaction of PVC yielding fuel gas. CaCO$_3$ degrades at high temperatures yielding only inert gas and residue. The initial mass fraction of these three components, the reaction yields and the heats of combustion are determined by comparing the mass loss results of the TGA analysis to the heat release results of the MCC.

The estimated reaction parameters are listed in Tables~\ref{christifire_kin_parameters_v1} and~\ref{christifire_kin_parameters_v2}.
The experimental and FDS results are shown in Fig.~\ref{christifire_small_scale_results}.

\subsection{Estimation of thermal parameters and validation}

The remaining pyrolysis model parameters were estimated by fitting the calculated cone calorimeter results to the experimental ones at 50~kW/m$^2$ heat flux.
The cone calorimeter sample consisting of seven cables is modeled as a rectangular solid. The layer structure of the cable sample is assumed to be
symmetrical:
\begin{enumerate}
\item sheath (2.1 mm)
\item insulation (2.1 mm)
\item conductor (2.5 mm)
\item insulation (2.1 mm)
\item sheath (2.1 mm)
\item insulating calcium silicate backing board (20 mm)
\end{enumerate}
The layer thicknesses are calculated using the component mass fractions and densities.
For fitting the thermal parameters, the experimental heat release rate and mass loss rate curves were used. The results of the fitted models are shown in
Fig.~\ref{christifire_cone_results_50}. The remaining parameters for v1 and v2 are listed in the following tables.

Next, the model parameters were fixed and the model is validated by comparing the FDS and eperimental results at 25~kW/m$^2$ and 75~kW/m$^2$ heat fluxes.
The results are shown in Fig.~\ref{christifire_cone_results_other_fluxes}.

\section{Liquid Pool Fires}

In this section, a series of liquid pool fires with different fuels is considered. The pool fires are assumed to burn in a 1~m by 1~m square tray, and the fuel layer is 10~cm thick. The burning rate of liquid hydrocarbon fuels has been found to correlate well with the ratio of the heat of combustion, $\Delta h_c$, and the heat of gasification, $\Delta h_g$:
\begin{equation}
\dot{m}''= 0.001 \; \frac{\Delta h_c}{\Delta h_g} \quad ; \quad \Delta h_g = \Delta h_v + \int_{T_0}^{T_b} c_p \; dT
\end{equation}
where $\Delta h_v$ is the latent heat of vaporization, $T_0$ is the initial temperature, $T_b$ is the boiling temperature, and $c_p$ is the specific heat of the liquid fuel. The heat of gasification, $\Delta h_g$, is the amount of energy required to raise the fuel from its initial temperature to its boiling temperature and evaporate it. Figure~\ref{POOL_MLR} shows a comparison of predicted burning rates with data taken from Ref.~\cite{SFPE}.

The absorption coefficients for benzene and ethanol are based on curve fits to experimental data as explained in Appendix K of the FDS Technical Reference Guide. The absorption coefficient for methanol presented in Appendix K is calculated with the aasumption that the incoming radiation is approximately blackbody radiation. The absorption coefficient for ethanol is calculated based on experimentally determined spectrum of an ethanol flame. Since both methanol and ethanol flames are low sooting, the blackbody radiation assumption is not correct. Instead it is assumed that the absorption coefficient for methanol should be of similar magnitude as that for ethanol. For heptane, butane and acetone the absorption coefficients are simple order of magnitude estimates.

Table~\ref{fuelprops} lists the liquid fuel properties used in the simulations. Note that the heats of vaporization are evaluated at the liquid boiling points. The thermal conductivities are listed in Ref.~\cite{CRCHandbook}, except for butane, which is found in Ref.~\cite{Webbook:FluidThermo}.
