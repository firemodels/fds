</ol>

<li>5.3 (build 2720) - November 23, 2008
<ol>

on a <tt>&SLCF</tt> line in an FDS input file (requires FDS built with svn revision 2690 or later).

<li> enhancement: Optionally hide slice data residing on the coarse mesh portion of a region refined by an imbedded mesh -
so that data from both meshes are not displayed simultaneously.
(<a href="http://code.google.com/p/fds/issues/detail?id=531&can=1&sort=-id">Issue 531</a>).

<li>  enhancement - Add option to control placement of scaling ticks (through the Display dialog box) used

<li> enhancement - Add menu item and command key equivalent (%) for toggling the projection type.  Pressing '%' toggles between
perspective and size preserving projection methods for displaying the scene.

<li> enhancement: Add a dialog box for setting up and running smokeview scripts.
The dialog box includes several items such as specifying a custom configuration/.ini file name for later loading by the script, specifying custom render images file names,
specifying the render directory.  As a result, the edits required to finalize the auto-generated script are minimal.

<li> enhancement: Improve the layout and functionality of the motion dialog box.
(<a href="http://code.google.com/p/fds/issues/detail?id=534&can=1&sort=-id">Issue 534</a>).

<p><li> fix: hrrpuvcutoff values now clamped down to 1199.99 since hrrpuv 3d file data can ONLY contain hrrpuv's between 0 and 1200.  A hrrpuvcutoff value greater
than 1200.0 would result in hiding of ALL hrrpuv data.
(<a href="http://code.google.com/p/fds/issues/detail?id=524&can=1&sort=-id">Issue 524</a>).

<li>fix - correct skip frame option in both Smokeview and Smokezip allowing users to load bigger cases by skipping data frames.
(<a href="http://code.google.com/p/fds/issues/detail?id=513&can=1&sort=-id">Issue 513</a>).

to make clear that hilighted regions are not necessarily
burning but have simply exceeded a specified temperature threshold value.
<li>fix - Update the smooth blockage cache file if a case has been re-run in order to avoid reading that is out of date.
<li>fix - make particles and smoke conform to terrain if terrain is vertically exaggerated .
</ol>

<li>5.2.4 (build 2236) - August 27, 2008
<ol>

(<a href="http://code.google.com/p/fds/issues/detail?id=412&can=1&sort=-id">Issue 412</a>).
</ol>

<li>5.2 (build 2039) - July 17, 2008
<ol>
<li>enhancement - Add an option to speed up smoke visualization by using the
graphics programming unit (GPU) to perform some of the needed computations.
This option is not supported on Linux or Mac OSX releases of Smokeview.
The option is turned off
by default and may be toggled on and off by pressing the 'G' key.

<li>enhancement - add the ability to run Smokeview in a <em>batch</em> or unattended
mode.  This mode may be used to automatically load a data file, view it from
a prescribed direction and render the resulting image.  This may be repeated for other views
and/or other data files.  A script named <em>casename.ssf</em> may be executed by typing
<p><tt>smokeview -runscript casename </tt>
<p>at a command line or from the <tt>Load/Unload>Script Options</tt> menu.
Scripts are created by adding desired commands to a text file named casename.ssf
or by turning on the <em>script recorder</em> found in the
Load/Unload>Script Options menu.

<li>enhancment - internal change in smokeview resulting in reduced memory
requirements when loading large cases.

<li>enhancement - When performing WUI computations, allow slice and vector slice files to conform to a

<li>enhancement - save the size preserving or perspective projection state in the .ini file
(<a href="http://code.google.com/p/fds/issues/detail?id=331&can=1&sort=-id">Issue 331</a>).
<li>enhancement - implement the "AUTOTERRAIN" keyword for WUI applications of FDS.  If all blockages are used to implement terrain
(ie no blockages are used to represent buildings on the terrain), then AUTOTERRAIN is used to signal Smokeview to draw a smooth
surface representing the terrain.
<li>enhancement -  add option to toggle slice file offset -
(<a href="http://code.google.com/p/fds/issues/detail?id=348&can=1&sort=-id">Issue 348</a>).
<li>enhancement - add support for skipping particle frames created by FDS 5 or later.
(<a href="http://code.google.com/p/fds/issues/detail?id=350&can=1&sort=-id">Issue 350</a>).
<li>fix - For particle files created by FDS 5, remove the particle skip option as it is no longer supported. (<a href="http://code.google.com/p/fds/issues/detail?id=350&can=1&sort=-id">Issue 350</a>).
<li>fix - change a conversion factor from 256*128 to 256*128-1 to avoid a "short int" overflow.   Otherwise, some
particles may be drawn outside the solution domain.
(<a href="http://code.google.com/p/fds/issues/detail?id=323&can=1&sort=-id">Issue 323</a>).
<li>fix - fix the 't' toggle when the grid is turned on.
(<a href="http://code.google.com/p/fds/issues/detail?id=334&can=1&sort=-id">Issue 334</a>).
<li>fix - force smooth blockages to be drawn opaquely to prevent drawing artifact errors when drawn with smoke.

<li>fix - Fix drawing when smoke, iso and slice routines have non-increasing time steps.
This could occur when FDS is restarted to an earlier time than was saved in these data files.
(<a href="http://code.google.com/p/fds/issues/detail?id=317&can=1&sort=-id">Issue 317</a>).
<li>fix - fix drawing of text on the colorbar

This mode is used to demonstrate an FDS/Smokeview case by presenting a simplified dialog box with pre-defined tours
<li>enhancement - add the command line option -skip val to the companion program <bold>smokezip</bold> to allow
frame skipping specifiation when running this tool from a command shell.
