\chapter{Disclaimer}

The US Department of Commerce makes no warranty, expressed or implied,
to users of the Fire Dynamics Simulator (FDS), and accepts no responsibility for its use.
Users of FDS assume sole responsibility under Federal law for determining
the appropriateness of its use in any particular application;
for any conclusions drawn from the results of its use; and for any
actions taken or not taken as a result of analysis performed using these tools.

Users are warned that FDS is intended for use only by those competent
in the fields of fluid dynamics, thermodynamics, heat transfer, combustion, and fire science,
and is intended only to supplement the informed judgment of the qualified user.
The software package is a computer model that may or may not have predictive
capability when applied to a specific set of factual circumstances.
Lack of accurate predictions by the model could lead to erroneous
conclusions with regard to fire safety. All results should be evaluated by an informed user.

Throughout this document, the mention of computer hardware or commercial
software does not constitute endorsement by NIST, nor does it indicate that
the products are necessarily those best suited for the intended purpose.

\chapter{Preface}

This is Volume 4 of the FDS Technical Reference Guide. Volume 1 describes the mathematical model and numerical method. Volumes~2 and 3 document past and
present model verification and validation work, respectively. Instructions for using FDS are contained in a separate User's Guide~\cite{FDS_Users_Guide_5}.

The volumes that make up the FDS Technical Reference Guide are based in part on the ASTM E 1355, {\em Standard Guide for Evaluating the Predictive Capability of
Deterministic Fire Models}~\cite{ASTM:E1355}. ASTM~E~1355 outlines the process of assessing the accuracy of a fire model. Volumes~1 through 3 are the
result of this evaluation process. The main purpose of the present volume is to describe the process by which the model software is developed and maintained. A model such
as FDS cannot remain static. As progress is made in fire science, the model needs to be updated and improved, but still shown to reliably predict the kinds of
phenomena for which it was originally designed.

\chapter{Acknowledgments}

\label{acksection}

The idea for this Guide originated with Jason Floyd, a co-developer of FDS and practicing engineer at Hughes Associates, Inc. He readily saw the need
for a clear description of the process of developing and maintaining FDS and Smokeview. Bryan Klein of NIST instituted a number of the internet tools that
are described in the Guide, including the source code repository, issue tracking system, and discussion group sites.

\chapter{Introduction}


\section{Purpose}

The purpose of this document is to describe the policies and procedures for developing and maintaining the Fire Dynamics Simulator (FDS).
Such a document is commonly referred to as a {\em Configuration Management Plan},
known through the rest of this document as ``the Plan.'' This document will be updated as the necessity arises and will establish and provide
the basis for a uniform and concise standard of practice for the FDS development process. It is based in part on IEEE Standard 828~\cite{IEEE-828}.


\subsection{Overview of the Fire Dynamics Simulator (FDS) Software Project}

FDS is a Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) model of fire-driven fluid flow.
The model solves numerically a form of the Navier-Stokes equations appropriate
for low-speed, thermally-driven flow with an emphasis on smoke and heat transport
from fires. The partial derivatives of the conservation equations of mass, momentum and energy are approximated
as finite differences, and the solution is updated in time on a three-dimensional, rectilinear grid.
Thermal radiation is computed using a finite volume technique on the same grid as the flow solver.
Lagrangian particles are used to simulate smoke movement, sprinkler discharge, and fuel sprays.

\subsection{Applicability}

This document applies only to the program FDS, its companion visualization program called Smokeview,  the related NIST publications and Internet site, and
the various utility programs that support the two main programs. This document does not apply to third-party software developed by others not affiliated with
NIST or its software development collaborators.


\subsection{Assumptions}

The policies and procedures described in this document involve the use of a variety of open source and commercial software and Internet utilities.
The continued availability of these resources is an important consideration in the day to day upkeep of FDS and Smokeview.
If these resources become unavailable for any reason, the procedures will be updated accordingly.

\chapter{Roles and Responsibilities}

This chapter describes the roles and responsibilities of the FDS and Smokeview developers.

\section{Development Team Members}

Primary support for the development and maintenance of the Fire Dynamics Simulator (FDS) and Smokeview is provided by the Building and Fire
Research Laboratory (BFRL) of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), an agency of the United States Department of Commerce.
The software developers themselves and experimental support personnel
work mainly within the Fire Research Division of BFRL. In addition, external collaborators include staff members of the research laboratory VTT of Finland, guest researchers at NIST,
and grantees of the NIST extramural fire grants program.

Members of the FDS and Smokeview team share in the development and maintenance responsibilities, which include:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Developing new algorithms and improving program functionality
\item Answering user questions
\item Responding to bug reports
\item Issuing periodic updates to the officially released versions of the programs
\item Maintaining the Technical Reference and Users Guides
\item Maintaining a suite of sample cases to demonstrate model use
\item Maintaining a suite of verification and validation cases to test model accuracy and reliability
\item Developing and maintaining a ``Road Map'' of future development
\end{enumerate}
Most decisions concerning these various tasks are made individually or by consensus of the team members.
In the event of a disagreement over technical issues, the decision is made by Kevin McGrattan, leader of the Fire Modeling Group in the Fire Research Division of BFRL,
in consultation with team members at VTT, Finland.
Non-technical issues are addressed by Anthony Hamins, Chief of the Fire Research Division in BFRL, or by
Shyam Sunder, Director of BFRL, depending on the nature of the issue. All policies and procedures described in this document are
subject to review by NIST in consultation with VTT, Finland.






\chapter{Software Maintenance}

Software maintenance consists of the following components:
control of the project files and documents, procedures for making changes, and procedures for testing new versions.


\section{Document Identification and Control}

Document identification and control consists of placing all project files in a central location and maintaining a record of changes to those files.
The central location is known as the {\em Repository}.


\subsection{Project Repository}

All project documents are maintained using the online utility \href{http://code.google.com/opensource}{{Google Code Project Hosting}}, a free service
offered by Google to support software development for open source applications.  Google Code uses the \href{http://subversion.tigris.org}{{Subversion}} (SVN) revision management system.
Under this system a centralized repository containing all project files resides on a Google Code server.
Subversion uses a single integer that identifies the version of the entire repository rather than of a specific file
(i.e. anytime a change is made to the repository all files are incremented in version number).  A record of version number when a specific file was last changed is maintained.

As an open source program, any individual can obtain a copy of the repository or retrieve specific versions
repository.  Only Team Members described in the previous chapter can commit changes to the repository.

The current location of the FDS repository is \href{http://fds-smv.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/}
{{\ct http://fds-smv.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/}}. The repository contains the following files:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Compiled FDS and Smokeview executables
\item FDS and Smokeview source code files
\item FDS and Smokeview documentation
\item Input files for software testing, verification testing, and validation testing
\item Experimental data files used for validation testing
\item Scripts and post-processing utilities used for software testing
\item Web pages and wikis
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Version Identification}

At the start of an FDS simulation FDS writes header information to the Smokeview output file, FDS output file,
and the FDS log file.  This header information contains the version of FDS used to perform that simulation.
While each release is tagged with a specific version number (e.g. 5.0.1), there may be many commits of source
code, documentation, or other files to the SVN repository before a new version is released with an incremented
version number.  Thus, if a developer or a user who performs their own compilation between baseline releases
discovers an error, the version number written to the output files may not be sufficient to identify the
specific set of source code files used.  Rather one would need to know the SVN revision number of the most
recently committed source file.

This is accomplished by using source file tagging.  In each source file a series of character parameter
strings are defined.  For example, near the top of the file called main.f90 at revision 3144 are lines of the form:

\begin{figure}[ht!]
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{FIGURES/RevisionStrings.jpg}
\caption{\bf Example of Revision Identification Strings in main.f90}
\label{fig:revstrings}
\end{figure}

\noindent
The string contains the name of the source file, the version of the file (this reflects only the source
file version and not the overall release version number), the date and time of the file version, and
the person who checked the file in to the archive.  Upon compiling, these strings will be stored in the
executable file.  The user is then capable of searching the executable file, for example, for strings
beginning with {\ct \$Id:}.  This will result in a list of all source files compiled and their version.
Within the SVN archive any specific version of a source file can be extracted and differences between
versions can be determined.

Within the source code a series of subroutines were created, one per source file, which parses the {\ct \$Id:} in
each file and extracts from it the SVN revision number.  Each of these subroutines is called at the start
of an FDS run and the largest (and hence most recent) revision number is determined.  This number is written
along with the FDS version number to the output header information.  A user can now identify specifically
the source code used for a particular compilation of FDS when reporting an error.


\section{Software Changes}

\subsection{Creating a Change Request}

Change requests are submitted using the FDS Issue Tracker.  The Issue Tracker is an online service that is part of
Google Code.  To submit a new issue to the tracker or to provide follow up comments, the user must sign in with a Google Account.
The current location of the Issue Tracker can be found through a link under the 'Support' section of the menu
on the FDS-SMV website \href{http://code.google.com/p/fds-smv/issues/list}{[Link to Tracker]}.

A change request is initiated by opening a new issue.  The issue report contains the baseline identification (version number, compile date, and SVN revision number),
operating system, and a description of the defect or enhancement request.  Input files or other supporting documentation can be attached.

\begin{figure}[ht!]
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{FIGURES/NewIssue.jpg}
\caption{\bf Screenshot of issue tracker reporting form}
\label{fig:issueform}
\end{figure}

If the issue is opened by a user, it will be given a status of 'New' until it is reviewed by a developer.  If the
issue is opened by a developer, the developer can immediate assign a status and an owner.

\subsection{Processing a Change Request}

A change request may be evaluated by any member of the development team.
If the request duplicates an existing request, then the issue status is changed to {\ct Duplicate} and the
requestor is sent the issue number of the existing request.

If the request is for an enhancement to FDS, then then the issue type is changed to {\ct Type-Enhancement} and the
component type is declared. The request is evaluated for suitability.  If it is a valid enhancement
request, then the status is changed to {\ct Accepted}.  If the request is not to
be addressed under the next baseline, then the status will be changed to {\ct OnHold}.  If the request is denied, then
the status is changed to {\ct WontFix}.  An accepted request will be assigned to a developer.

If the request is identifying a defect in FDS, then the issue type is changed to {\ct Type-Defect} and the
component type is declared.  The defect is evaluated for validity.  If insufficient information has
been provided in the request, then the status is changed to {\ct MoreInfo} and a description of the additional
information required is sent to the requestor.  If the defect is due to user error or is the intended function of FDS,
then the status is changed to {\ct Invalid}.  If the defect is valid, then the request reviewer will change the
status to {\ct Accepted} and assign the request to a developer.

Once a change request has be addressed by a developer and changes submitted to the repositoty, the request status
is changed to {\ct Fixed}.  Once either the requestor or another developer has verified that the changes address
the original request, then the status is changed to {\ct Verified}.


\subsection{Committing Changes}

Once a developer has addressed a change request, the modified files are committed to the SVN repository.  A description
of the changes will be added to the SVN change log.  This description first identifies the primary component being
changed (for example: FDS Source or FDS Documentation).  This component identification will be followed by a brief
summary of the changes made.  The issue identifier will be included as part of that brief description.

\subsection{Change Verification}

Once a change has been committed and the issue tracker updated to reflect that the issue has been {\ct Fixed},
the changes will be verified.  Verification can be done by either the requester of the change or by another
developer.  Once the changes have been verified to solve the problem reported in the issue, the issue status will
be changed to {\ct Verified}.  At this point the issue is closed.



\section{Issuing New Releases}

The decision to change versions of the software is made by consensus of the development team, usually after it is determined that enough
changes have been made to warrant a new release. There is no formal process to determine when a new release is to be issued. However, once the
decision is made, the new version is given a number, it is tested, and then posted to the official download site.

\subsection{Version Number}

New versions of FDS and Smokeview are identified using a specific numbering convention, for example, {\em FDS 5.2.5}.
The version number consists of three integers separated by periods, where the first number
is the {\em major} release, the second is the {\em minor} release, and the third is the {\em maintenance}
release.  Major releases occur every few years, and as the name implies dramatically changed functionality of the
model. Minor releases occur every few months, and may cause minor changes in functionality.
Release notes can help you decide whether the changes should effect the type of applications that you typically do.
Maintenance releases are either just bug fixes or the addition of minor enhancements (such as a new output quantity),
and should not affect code functionality.

For each release of FDS there is a unique Subversion (SVN) repository revision number associated with it.
For example, FDS version 5.3.0 was built from files in the repository at SVN revision number 3193.
The document connecting the release version to the SVN revision number is found in the {\em FDS Release Notes} wiki page
located at \href{http://code.google.com/p/fds-smv/wiki/FDS_Release_Notes}{{\ct http://code.google.com/p/fds-smv/wiki/FDS\_Release\_Notes}}
The SVN revision number allows users to checkout or update their local copy of the project files from the repository to the same state as any previous release of the software.

\subsection{Testing a New Release}

Each proposed release undergoes software testing.  There are two sets of input files that are used to test new releases --
a verification suite and a validation suite. The verification suite consists of a range of calculations, from ones that just test a feature to
ones that compare FDS results with analytical solutions of the governing equations. The validation suite consists of simulations of a wide range
of experiments.

Testing will depend upon the type of baseline release:
maintenance, minor, or major. A maintenance release occurs every few weeks.
Each maintenance release is tested with the verification suite. Because each case requires no more than a few
hours of computer time, the suite can be run overnight. The following day, the results of the calculations are automatically plotted and
compared with the expected results. This is done simply be recompiling the FDS User's Guide and Verification Guide, each of which contains pictures
and graphs that demonstrate the test was successful.

A minor release occurs every three to six months.
Each minor release is tested with both the verification and validation suites. The validation cases take considerably longer to run, but the
procedure is similar -- the results are plotted and compared to the experimental measurements using an automated plotting package that
essentially redraws all of the plots and graphs in the FDS Validation Guide. The old and new guides are compared to assess whether or not
the new version of the model has become noticeably less accurate than the old. Work is underway to better quantify this procedure.

A major release of FDS occurs every few years. As the name implies, major changes are made to the algorithm, requiring months of beta testing, and several
runs through the V\&V suites.


\subsection{Announcing a New Version}

Following successful completion of the required baseline testing, a baseline can be released.  Prior to release, the
version identification information within the FDS source code will be updated to reflect the new baseline.  FDS
documentation will be updated to reflect the new baseline.  The baseline will be compiled and new executable files
or installation packages will be placed on the FDS download site.  Prior baselines will be deprecated.  The
current FDS download site is \href{http://code.google.com/p/fds-smv/downloads/list}
{{\ct http://code.google.com/p/fds-smv/downloads/list}}.
