<h3>Initial Setup</h3>
<ul>
<li>Copy <tt>SMV_5\scripts\fds_smv_env.bat</tt> to your home directory (directory that opens up when you start up  a command shell)
<li>Define keyword values (only needed to be done once) for your own setup.  Example:
<blockquote>
set svn_root=d:\fds-smv<br>
set svn_drive=d:<br>
set linux_svn_root=FDS-SMV<br>
set linux_username=gforney<br>
set google_username=gforney<br>
set linux_hostname=acrux.cfr.nist.gov<br>
</blockquote>
<li><a href="scripts/EDIT_setup.bat">Edit configuration file</a> Define environmental variables used by the scripts on this page 
(such as svn revision numbers, user names, local SVN repository location, <em>etc.</em>).
<li>Intel Compilers
<ol>
<li>Install Intel Fortran and C/C++ compilers - version 11
<li>Put Intel environmental setup scripts in <tt>c:\bin</tt> (copy <tt>iclvars.bat</tt> and <tt>ifortvars.bat</tt> from the
Intel compiler bin directories to <tt>c:\bin</tt>)
</ol>
<li>Putty
<ol>
<li>Install putty.  Doesn't matter where - just make sure the install directory is in the <em>path</em>
<li>Set up ssh keys to let you login into the Linux cluster without a password.  Basically you are creating a public/private pair 
of ssh keys.  You copy the private key to somewhere on your PC (doesn't really matter where) 
and copy the public key into a file on the Linux cluster.  More precisely:
<ol>
<li>run puttygen
<li>click on the <tt>SSH-2 RSA</tt> radio button
<li>click on the <tt>Generate</tt> button.  Pick a <em>pass-phrase</em> that you can easily remember.
<li>Save the private key into c:\bin\keys directory (create the directory it if it doesn't exist)
<li>Save the public key and copy it to the Linux cluster.  Put the key at the end of the file <tt>authorized_key2</tt> which
is located in the <tt>.ssh</tt> directory (in your home directory)
</ol>
<li>Run the program <tt>Pageant</tt> (it is part of the putty suite of programs) to activate the ssh keys.  
You should put it in the startup directory so that it automatically runs when you boot your computuer.  It will direct you to open your private key
and ask you for the pass-phrase used to create it.
</ol>
<li>Create a file named <tt>gc.passwd</tt> containing your google password and put it in your windows home directory.
<li>Winzip
<ol>
<li>Install Winzip version 12, Winzip command line tool and Winzip self extractor.  
Note, The Winzip command line tool is free but is a separate download from Winzip 12.  
The Winzip self extractor needs to be purchased separately.
<li>Put winzip tools in <tt>c:\bin\winzip</tt>
</ol>
</ul>
