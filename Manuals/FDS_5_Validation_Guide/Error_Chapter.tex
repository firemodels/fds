\chapter{Quantifying Model Uncertainty}

\section{Introduction}

The most effective way of introducing the subject of uncertainty in fire modeling is by way of an example.
Suppose that a fire model is used to estimate the likelihood that an electrical control cable could be damaged by
a fire. It is assumed that the cable loses functionality when its surface temperature reaches 400~$^\circ$C,
and the model predicts that the cable temperature could reach as high as 350~$^\circ$C.
Does this mean that there is no chance of damage? The answer is no, because the input parameters, like the heat release rate of
the fire, and the model assumptions, like the way the cables are modeled, are uncertain. The combination of the
two -- the {\em parameter uncertainty} and the {\em model uncertainty} -- leave open the possibility that the cable temperature could exceed
400~$^\circ$C.

This \paper addresses {\em model uncertainty} only and suggests a simple method to quantify it. While parameter uncertainty is certainly an
important consideration in fire modeling, its treatment varies considerably depending on the particular application. For example, in what is often
referred to as a ``bounding analysis,'' the model input parameters are chosen so as to simulate a ``maximum credible'' or ``worst case'' fire. In other cases,
mean values of the input parameters constitute a ``50th percentile'' design scenario.
Sometimes entire statistical distributions, rather than individual values, of the input parameters are ``propagated'' through the model in a variety of ways, leading to
a statistical distribution of the model output. Notarianni and Parry survey these techniques in the SFPE Handbook~\cite{Notarianni:SFPE}.
Regardless of the method that is chosen for assessing the impact of the input parameters on the model prediction, there needs to be a way of
quantifying the uncertainty of the model itself. In other words, how good is the prediction for a given set of input parameters?

The issue of model uncertainty has been around as long as the models themselves. The scenario above,
for example, was considered by Siu and Apostolakis in the early 1980s~\cite{Siu:RE1982} as part of their development of risk models for
nuclear power plants. The fire models at the
time were relatively simple. In fact, many were engineering correlations in the form of simple formulae. This made the methods for
quantifying their uncertainty reasonably tractable because each formula consisted of only a handful of physical parameters. Over the past
thirty years, however, both fire modeling and the corresponding methods of uncertainty analysis have become far more complex. The current
generation of computational fluid dynamics fire models require such a large number of physical and numerical parameters that it is considered
too cumbersome to estimate model uncertainty by systematically assessing their combined effect on the final prediction. The more
practical approach is to compare model predictions with actual fire experiments in a validation study, the conclusions of which typically come in the form of statements like:
``The model generally over-predicts the measured temperatures
by about 10~\%,'' or ``The model predictions are within about 20~\% of the measured heat fluxes.'' This information is helpful,
at the very least to demonstrate that the model is appropriate for the given application.
However, even the statement that the model over-predicts measured temperatures by 10~\% is useful not only to gain acceptance of the model but also
to provide a better sense of the model's accuracy, and a greater level of assurance in answering the question posed above. Knowing that the model
not only predicted a temperature of 350~$^\circ$C, but also that the model tends to over-predict temperatures by a certain amount, increases the confidence that
the postulated fire would not cause the cable to fail. The probability of cable failure could be quantified further via a statistical distribution
like the one shown in Fig.~\ref{bell_curve}. The area indicated by the shaded region is the probability that the temperature will exceed 400~$^\circ$C,
even though the model has predicted a peak temperature of only 350~$^\circ$C.

\end{figure}

This \paper suggests a method for expressing {\em model uncertainty} by way of a distribution like the one shown in Fig.~\ref{bell_curve}.
The procedure is not a dramatic departure from the current
practice of fire model validation in that it relies entirely on comparisons of model predictions and experimental measurements. The advantage of
the approach is that it does not demand advanced knowledge of statistics or details of the numerical model. The parameters of the distribution shown in
Fig.~\ref{bell_curve}, namely the mean and standard deviation, are not generated by the model user. Rather, they are reported as the results of the
validation study. The calculation of the probability of exceeding some critical threshold ({\em i.e.} the area under the curve) is a simple
table look-up or function call in data analysis software like Microsoft Excel\textregistered.



\section{Sources of Model Uncertainty}

A deterministic fire model is based on fundamental conservation laws of mass, momentum and energy,
applied either to entire compartments or smaller control
volumes that make up the compartments. A CFD model may use millions of control volumes to compute the
solution of the Navier-Stokes equations.
However, it does not actually solve the Navier-Stokes equations, but rather an approximate form of these equations.
The approximation involves simplifying
physical assumptions, like the various techniques for treating subgrid-scale turbulence.
One critical approximation is the discretization of the governing equations. For example,
the partial derivative of the density, $\rho$,
with respect to the spatial coordinate, $x$, can be written in approximate form as:
\be \frac{\partial \rho}{\partial x} = \frac{\rho_{i+1} - \rho_{i-1}}{2 \, \dx} + \mathcal{O}(\dx^2) \ee
where $\dx$ is the grid spacing chosen by the model user.
The second term on the right represents all of the terms of order $\dx^2$ and higher in the Taylor
series expansion and are known collectively as the
{\em discretization error}. These extra terms are simply dropped from
the equation set, the argument being that they become smaller and smaller with decreasing grid cell size, $\dx$.
The effect of these neglected terms is captured, to
some extent, by the subgrid-scale turbulence model, but that is yet another approximation of the true physics.
What effect do these approximations have on
the predicted results? It is very difficult to determine based on an analysis of the discretized equations.
One possibility for estimating
the magnitude of the discretization error is to perform a detailed
convergence analysis, but this still does not answer a
question like, ``What is the uncertainty of the model prediction of the gas
temperature at a particular location in the room at a particular point in time?''

To make matters worse, there are literally dozens of subroutines that make up a CFD fire model,
from its transport equations, radiation solver, solid phase heat transfer routines, pyrolysis model,
empirical mass, momentum and energy transfer routines at the wall, and so on.
It has been suggested by some that
a means to quantify the model uncertainty is to combine the uncertainties of all the model
components in a way similar to that of the input parameters.
However, such an exercise is very difficult, especially for a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model,
for a number of reasons. First, fire involves
a complicated interaction of gas and solid phase phenomena that are closely coupled.
Second, grid sensitivity in a CFD model or the error associated with
a two-layer assumption in a zone model are dependent on the particular fire scenario.
Third, fire is an inherently transient phenomenon in which relatively small
changes in events, like a door opening or sprinkler actuation, can lead to significant changes in outcome.

Rather than attempt to decompose the model into its constituent parts and assess the uncertainty of
each, the strategy adopted here is to compare model predictions to as many
experiments as possible. This has been the traditional approach for quantifying model uncertainty in fire
protection engineering because of the relative abundance of test data. Consider, for example, the
plot shown in Fig.~\ref{scatterplot}. This is the typical outcome of a validation study, where in this case a series of
heat flux measurements are compared with model predictions.
The diagonal line indicates where the prediction and measurement agree.
But because there is uncertainty associated with each, it cannot be said that the model is perfect if its predictions
agree exactly with measurements.
There needs to be a way of quantifying the uncertainties of each before any conclusions can be drawn.
Such an exercise would result in the uncertainty
bars\footnote{The data in Fig.~\ref{scatterplot} was extracted from Ref.~\cite{NUREG_1824}.
The uncertainty bars are for demonstration only.}
shown in the figure. The
horizontal bar associated with each point represents the uncertainty in the measurement itself.
For example, the heat flux gauge is subject to uncertainty due to its design and fabrication.
Because the horizontal bar represents the experimental uncertainty, it is assumed that the vertical
bar represents the model uncertainty. This is only partially true. In fact the vertical bar represents the total
uncertainty of the prediction, which is a combination of the {\em model} and {\em parameter} uncertainties. The physical
input parameters, like the heat release rate and material properties, are based on measurements that are reported
in the documentation of the experiment.
The total {\em experimental uncertainty} is represented by all of the horizontal bar and part of the vertical.
If the {\em experimental uncertainty} can be quantified, then the {\em model uncertainty} can be obtained as a result.

\section{Quantifying the Experimental Uncertainty}

As discussed in the previous section, the {\em experimental uncertainty} is a combination of the uncertainty
in the measurement of the quantity of interest, like the gas temperature or heat flux, along with the propagated
uncertainty of the measured test parameters, like the heat release rate or material properties.
``Propagated uncertainty'' is, in this case, what has been referred to above as the parameter uncertainty.
It is not the uncertainty of the parameter itself, but rather the uncertainty in the predicted quantity
resulting from the uncertainty of the parameter.

In a recent fire model validation study conducted by the U.S.~Nuclear Regulatory Commission~\cite{NUREG_1824},
Hamins estimated the experimental uncertainty for several full-scale fire experiments. There were
two uncertainty estimates needed for each quantity of interest. The first was an estimate, expressed in the
form of a 95~\% confidence interval, of the
uncertainty in the measurement of the quantity itself. For example, reported gas and surface temperatures
were made with thermocouples of various designs (bare-bead,
shielded, aspirated) with different size beads, metals, and so on. For each, one can estimate the
uncertainty in the reported measurement.

Next, the
uncertainty of the measurements of the reported test parameters was estimated, including the heat release rate,
leakage area, ventilation rate, material
properties, and so on. It was then necessary to calculate how the uncertainty in these parameters contributed to
the uncertainty of the reported measurement. To do this, Hamins
examined a number of empirical formulae that are widely used in fire protection engineering to determine the
most important test parameters and their effect on the measured results. These formulae provided the means of propagating
the parameter uncertainties through the experiment.
For example, it has been shown~\cite{SFPE:Walton} that the hot gas layer temperature rise, $T-T_0$, due to
a compartment fire is proportional to the heat release rate, $\dot{Q}$, raised to the two-thirds power:
\be T-T_0 = C \, \dot{Q}^{\frac{2}{3}} \ee
The constant, $C$, involves a number of geometric and thermo-physical parameters that are unique to the given
fire scenario. By way of differentials, this empirical relationship can be expressed in the form:
\be \frac{\Delta T}{T-T_0} \approx \frac{2}{3} \, \frac{\Delta \dot{Q}}{\dot{Q}}  \ee
In words, the relative change in the temperature rise is approximately two-thirds the relative change
in the heat release rate. Assuming that the numerical model exhibits the same functional relationship between the compartment
temperature and the heat release rate, there is now a way to express the uncertainty of the model prediction as a function
of the uncertainty of this most
important input parameter. Often, the uncertainty of a measurement is expressed in the form of a 95~\% confidence interval,
(two standard deviations or 2$\sigma$).
Thus, if the heat release rate of a fire is assumed with 95~\% confidence to be
within 15~\% of the reported measurement, then the temperature
predicted by the model has an uncertainty\footnote{An uncertainty that is expressed in the form of a
percentage typically means one or two {\em relative} standard deviations, often denoted with a tilde,
$\widetilde{\sigma}=\sigma/\mu$.} of at least 10~\%.

\label{Parameter_Uncertainty}
\end{table}

The uncertainty of each measurement is expressed as a relative standard deviation. The uncertainty of the measured
\underline{o}utput quantity is denoted $\widetilde{\sigma}_o$, and the uncertainty of each
significant \underline{i}nput parameter is denoted $\widetilde{\sigma}_i$.
Assuming that all the uncertainties are uncorrelated, they are combined via the expression:
\be
   \widetilde{\sigma}_E^2 = \widetilde{\sigma}_o^2 + \sum_i p_i^2 \, \widetilde{\sigma}_i^2  \label{comb_unc}
\ee
The factors, $p_i$, represent the power dependencies of the individual input parameters.
Table~\ref{Parameter_Uncertainty} lists the most important physical parameters associated with various
measured quantities in the experiments and their power dependence.


Hamins estimated the combined experimental uncertainties for ten quantities of interest in the U.S.~NRC validation study.
The results are summarized in Table~\ref{Uncertainty}, with
each combined uncertainty reported in the form of a 95~\% confidence interval ({\em i.e.} $2 \, \widetilde{\sigma}_E$).
It is assumed throughout that both experiment and model uncertainties can be expressed in relative terms.
The assumption is based on a
qualitative assessment of dozens of scatter plots similar to that shown in Fig.~\ref{scatterplot} that show
the scattered points to form an expanding ``wedge''
about the diagonal line, or some other off-diagonal line due to an assumed bias in the model predictions.
This assessment is a critical component of the
analysis described in the next section.

\section{Calculating Model Uncertainty}

This section describes a method for calculating the {\em model uncertainty}. In terms of the example given in the Introduction, this
is the answer to the question, ``350~$^\circ$C plus or minus what?'' Actually, the ``plus or minus'' uncertainty bounds are expressed as a statistical distribution.
That is, the model prediction of the ``true'' temperature of the cable, $\theta$, is expressed in the
following way\footnote{$N(\mu,\sigma^2)$ denotes a normal (Gaussian) distribution
with mean, $\mu$, and standard deviation, $\sigma$.}:
\be
   \theta \; | \; 350 \sim N \left( \frac{350}{\delta} \; , \; \widetilde{\sigma}_M^2
   \left( \frac{350}{\delta} \right)^2 \right) \label{truthexample}
\ee
In words, given a model prediction of 350~$^\circ$C, the expected value of the true temperature is assumed to be normally distributed
with the given mean and standard deviation. The values of $\delta$ and $\widetilde{\sigma}_M$ are calculated based on the
comparison of model predictions with experimental measurements, and this calculation is discussed below. First, however,
there are a few very important assumptions that need to be justified.
\begin{enumerate}
\item The distribution is assumed to be normal. Given the
complexity of the models, it would be difficult to postulate a more precise functional relationship.
The same is true of the form of the distribution. Given the complexity of the models and the experiments,
it would be difficult to justify
any particular distribution. In fact, the very reason for developing this method of quantifying model
uncertainty based on validation
experiments is because the model algorithm itself is too complicated to work with directly
as a means of estimating the error. However, if
the distributions were better characterized, the methodology presented here could be generalized appropriately.
\item The degree to which the model under or over-predicts the ``truth'' is expressed as a multiplicative bias factor, $\delta$; thus,
the mean of the distribution in this case is $350/\delta$. If $\delta<1$, the model tends to under-predict, in which case it is
assumed that the true value would be greater than 350. If $\delta>1$, it is assumed that the true value would be less than 350.
\item The standard deviation of the distribution is expressed as a fixed percentage of the mean,
$\widetilde{\sigma}=\sigma/\mu$. This is based on the observation that the results of past validation exercises,
when plotted as shown in Fig.~\ref{scatterplot}, suggest
that the difference between predicted and measured values is roughly proportional to the magnitude of the measured value.
\end{enumerate}

With these assumptions in mind, it remains to show how the two parameters, $\delta$ and $\widetilde{\sigma}_M$, are calculated using the
results of a model validation study.
Such a study typically consists of comparing point measurements from a wide variety of fire experiments
with corresponding model predictions.
Figure~\ref{temp_history} is a typical result for a single point measurement, and given that usually
dozens of such measurements are made during each experiment,
and potentially dozens of experiments are conducted as part of a test series, hundreds of such plots can be
produced for any given quantity of interest.
\begin{figure}[t]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[height=2.5in]{FIGURES/sample_time_history}
\end{center}
\caption[Sample time history plots.]{Example of a typical time history comparison of model prediction and experimental measurement.}
\label{temp_history}
\end{figure}
Usually, the data is condensed into a more tractable form by way of a single metric with which to
compare the two curves like the ones shown in Fig.~\ref{temp_history}. Peacock {\em et al.}~\cite{Peacock:FSJ1999}
discuss various possible metrics. A commonly used metric is simply to compare the measured and predicted peak values.
If the data is spiky, some form of time-averaging can be used. Regardless of the exact form of the metric, what results from
this exercise is a pair of numbers for each plot, $(E_i,M_i)$, that can be depicted graphically as shown in Fig.~\ref{scatterplot}.

With these assumptions in mind, a relatively simple method of analyzing the data can be developed.
Assume that the set of model predictions and the corresponding set of experimental measurements are denoted
$M_i$ and $E_i$, respectively, where $i$ ranges from 1 to $n$ and both $M_i$ and $E_i$ are positive numbers
expressing the increase in the value of a quantity above its ambient.
As mentioned above, measurements from full-scale fire experiments often lack uncertainty estimates. In cases where the uncertainty is
reported, it is usually expressed as either a standard deviation or confidence interval about the measured value. In other words, there is rarely
a reported systematic bias in the measurement because if a bias can be quantified, the reported values are adjusted accordingly.
For this reason, assume that a given experimental measurement, $E_i$, is normally
distributed about the ``true'' value, $\theta_i$, and there is no systematic bias:
\be
   E \; | \; \theta \sim N(\theta \; , \; \sigma_E^2) \label{expunc}
\ee
The notation\footnote{Note that the subscript, $i$, has been dropped merely to reduce the notational clutter.}
$E \; | \; \theta$ means that $E$ is conditional on a particular value of $\theta$.
This is the usual way of defining a likelihood function.
It is convenient to use the so-called delta method\footnote{Given the random variable $X \sim N(\mu,\sigma^2)$, the
delta method~\cite{Oehlert:1992} provides a way to estimate the distribution of a function of $X$:
$$g(X) \sim N \left( g(\mu) + g''(\mu) \, \sigma^2/2 \, , \, (g'(\mu) \, \sigma)^2\right)$$} to obtain the approximate distribution
\be
   \ln E \; | \; \theta \sim N \left( \ln \theta - \frac{\widetilde{\sigma}_E^2}{2} \, , \,\widetilde{\sigma}_E^2 \right) \label{eeq}
\ee
The purpose of applying the natural log to the random variable is so that its variance can be expressed in terms of the
relative uncertainty, $\widetilde{\sigma}_E=\sigma_E/\theta$. This is convenient because it is assumed that the relative
uncertainty is constant for each quantity of interest. The quantities and uncertainty values are listed in Table~\ref{Uncertainty}.

It cannot be assumed, as in the case of the experimental measurements, that the model predictions have no systematic bias. Instead,
it is assumed that the model predictions are normally distributed about the true values
multiplied by a bias factor, $\delta$:
\be
   M \; | \; \theta \sim N \left(\delta \, \theta \, , \, \sigma_M^2 \right) \label{mdist}
\ee
The standard deviation, $\sigma_M$, and the bias factor, $\delta$, represent the model uncertainty.
Again, the delta method renders a distribution for $\ln M$ whose parameters can be expressed in terms of a
relative standard deviation:
\be
   \ln M \; | \; \theta \sim N \left(\ln \delta +\ln \theta - \frac{\widetilde{\sigma}_M^2}{2} \; , \;
   \widetilde{\sigma}_M^2 \right) \quad ; \quad \widetilde{\sigma}_M=\frac{\sigma_M}{\delta \, \theta} \label{meq}
\ee
Combining Eq.~(\ref{eeq}) with Eq.~(\ref{meq}) yields:
\be
   \ln M  - \ln E \sim N \left( \ln \delta - \frac{\widetilde{\sigma}_M^2}{2}+\frac{\widetilde{\sigma}_E^2}{2} \; ,
   \; \widetilde{\sigma}_M^2+\widetilde{\sigma}_E^2 \right) \label{lnMeq}
\ee
What is now needed is a way to estimate the mean and standard deviation of this combined distribution. First, define:
\be
   \overline{\ln M} = \frac{1}{n} \, \sum_{i=1}^n \, \ln M_i  \quad ; \quad
   \overline{\ln E} = \frac{1}{n} \, \sum_{i=1}^n \, \ln E_i
\ee
The least squares estimate\footnote{Note that $\hat{\sigma}$ denotes an estimate of $\sigma$.} of the standard
deviation of the combined distribution is defined as:
\be
   \widehat{ \widetilde{\sigma}_M^2 } + \widetilde{\sigma}_E^2  = \frac{1}{n-1} \sum_{i=1}^n \,
   \left[ \left(\ln M_i - \ln E_i \right) - \left( \overline{\ln M} - \overline{\ln E} \right)  \right]^2 \label{stdev}
\ee
Recall that $\widetilde{\sigma}_E$ is known and the expression on the right can be evaluated using the pairs of measured and
predicted values. An estimate of $\delta$ can be found using the mean of the distribution:
\be
   \hat{\delta} = \exp \left( \overline{\ln M}-\overline{\ln E}+\frac{ \widehat{\widetilde{\sigma}_M^2}}{2}-\frac{\widetilde{\sigma}_E^2}{2} \right) \label{delta}
\ee
Taking the assumed normal distribution of the model prediction, $M$, in Eq.~(\ref{mdist}) and using
a Bayesian argument\footnote{The form of Bayes theorem used here states that the posterior distribution is the product of
the prior distribution and the likelihood function, normalized by their integral:
$f(\theta|M)= p(\theta) \, f(M|\theta)/\int p(\theta) \, f(M|\theta) \, d\theta$.
A constant prior is also known as a Jeffreys prior~\cite{Gelman:Stats}.}
with a non-informative prior for $\theta$, the posterior distribution can be expressed:
\be
   \delta \, \theta \; | \; M \sim N \left( M \; , \; \sigma_M^2 \right) \label{thetaeq}
\ee
The assumption of a non-informative prior implies that there is not sufficient information about the
prior distribution ({\em i.e.} the true value) of
$\theta$ to assume anything other than a uniform\footnote{A uniform distribution means that for any two equally sized intervals of the real line,
there is an equal likelihood that the random variable takes a value in one of them.} distribution.
This is equivalent to saying that the modeler has not biased the model input parameters to compensate for a known
bias in the model output. For example, if a particular model has been shown to over-predict compartment temperature, and the modeler has reduced the specified heat release
rate to better estimate the true temperature, then it can no longer be assumed that the prior distribution of the true temperature is uniform.
Still another way to look at this is by analogy to target shooting. Suppose a particular rifle
has a manufacturers defect such that, on average, it shoots 10~cm to the left of the target. It must be assumed that any given shot by a marksman without this knowledge is
going to strike 10~cm to the left of the intended target. However, if the marksman knows of the defect, he or she will probably aim 10~cm to the right of the
intended target to compensate for the defect. If that is the case, it can no longer be assumed that the intended target was 10~cm to the right of the bullet hole.

The final step in the derivation is to rewrite Eq.~(\ref{thetaeq}) as:
\be
   \theta \; | \; M \sim N \left( \frac{M}{\hat{\delta}} \; , \; \widehat{\widetilde{\sigma}_M^2} \left( \frac{M}{\hat{\delta}} \right)^2 \right) \label{truth}
\ee
This formula has been obtained\footnote{Note that if $X \sim N(\mu,\sigma^2)$, then
$cX \sim N ( c \mu , (c \sigma)^2)$.} by dividing by the bias factor, $\delta$, in Eq.~(\ref{thetaeq}). To summarize, given a model prediction, $M$,
of a particular quantity of interest ({\em e.g.} a cable temperature), the true (but unknown) value of this quantity is normally distributed. The mean value
and variance of this normal distribution are based solely on comparisons of model predictions with past experiments that are similar to the particular fire
scenario being analyzed. The performance of the model is quantified by the estimators of the parameters, $\hat{\delta}$ and $\widehat{\widetilde{\sigma}_M}$, which
have been corrected to account for uncertainties associated with the experimental measurements. 
If $\hat{\delta} \approx 1$ and $\widehat{\widetilde{\sigma}_M} \approx \widetilde{\sigma}_E$, then the
model can be considered of comparable accuracy to the measurements. 


\section{Procedure}

This section describes how to make use of Eq.~(\ref{truth}). Referring to the sample problem given above, suppose a fire model is being used to estimate the likelihood that
electrical control cables could be damaged due to a fire in a compartment. 
Damage is assumed to occur when the surface temperature of any cable reaches 400~$^\circ$C. 
What is the likelihood that the cables would be damaged if the
model predicts that the maximum surface temperature of the cables is 350~$^\circ$C. Assuming that the input parameters are not in question, the following
procedure is suggested:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Assemble a collection of model predictions, $M_i$, and experimental measurements, $E_i$, from 
past experiments involving objects with similar thermal characteristics as the cables in question. 
How ``similar'' the experiment is to the hypothetical scenario under study can be quantified by way of
various parameters, like the thermal inertia of the object, the size of the fire, the size of the compartment, and so on. Obtain estimates of the
experimental uncertainty from those who conducted the experiments or follow the procedure outlined by Hamins~\cite{NUREG_1824}. Express the
experimental uncertainty in relative terms, $\widetilde{\sigma}_E$.
\item Calculate the bias factor, $\delta$, and relative standard deviation, $\tilde{\sigma}_M$, from Eqs.~(\ref{delta}) and (\ref{stdev}), respectively.
For this example, assume that $\delta=1.03$ and that $\widetilde{\sigma}_M=0.10$. 
\item Consider the distribution, Eq.~(\ref{truth}), of the ``true'' temperature, $\theta$, shown graphically in Fig.~\ref{bell_curve}.
The vertical lines indicate the ``critical'' temperature at which damage is assumed to occur ($T_c=400$~$^\circ$C), and the temperature predicted by the
model (350~$^\circ$C). Given an ambient temperature of 20~$^\circ$C, the predicted temperature rise, $M$, is 330~$^\circ$C.
The mean and standard deviation in Eq.~(\ref{truth}) are calculated:
\be \mu = 20 + \frac{M}{\delta} = 20 + \frac{330}{1.03} = 340.4 \; ^\circ \hbox{C}  \quad ; \quad
   \sigma = \widetilde{\sigma}_M \, \frac{M}{\hat{\delta}} = 0.10 \times \frac{330}{1.03} = 32 \; ^\circ \hbox{C}  \ee
respectively. The shaded area beneath the bell curve is the probability that the ``true'' temperature can exceed the
critical value, $T_c=400$~$^\circ$C, which can be expressed via the {\em complimentary error function}:
\be P(T>T_c) = \frac{1}{2} \hbox{efrc} \left( \frac{T_c - \mu}{\sigma \sqrt{2}} \right) \approx 0.03  \ee
This means that there is a 3~\% chance that the cables could become damaged, assuming that the model's input parameters are not
subject to uncertainty. 
\end{enumerate}
Of course, this analysis is not complete. It could never be assumed that the input parameters for a model calculation are perfect. At the very least, the heat
release rate of the fire would be selected from a range of plausible values. This selection, along with that of other parameters, would likely broaden the
bell curve shown in Fig.~\ref{bell_curve}. 

 

\section{Verifying the Calculation of the Uncertainty Parameters}

This section demonstrates the accuracy of the calculation of the estimated model uncertainty parameters $\hat{\delta}$ and $\widehat{\widetilde{\sigma}_M}$. To do so,
hypothetical values of experimental measurements and model predictions are selected from known distributions to check that the estimates of the model
bias and standard deviation are accurate.
Suppose that 1000 fire experiments are conducted, and that for each experiment the
temperature at a given point and at a given time is known. For the sake of this exercise, assume that these values can be represented by 1000 uniformly distributed
random numbers, $\theta_i$, between 0 and 1000. These values have no uncertainty -- they represent the ``truth.''
Of course, the true values can never be known, but for this hypothetical exercise they are assumed.
Next, with $\theta_i$ as the mean, a normally-distributed random variable is chosen that represents a hypothetical measurement, $E_i$.
The relative standard deviation of the distribution, $\widetilde{\sigma}_E$, is assumed known. In the same way, a normally-distributed
random variable is chosen that represents a hypothetical
model prediction, $M_i$. The mean of distribution $\delta \, \theta_i$ and the relative standard deviation, $\widetilde{\sigma}_M$,
is specified.
This procedure creates 1000 pairs of $(E_i,M_i)$ with which the procedure outlined in the previous section can be tested.
Using the 1000 pairs of values and the experimental uncertainty, $\widetilde{\sigma}_E$, the specified model bias, $\hat{\delta}$,
and relative error, $\widetilde{\sigma}_M$, of the hypothetical model predictions should be accurately estimated.

Two examples are considered. For the first example, assume that the model has no bias ($\delta=1$) and that the relative uncertainty of the measurements and the
relative error of the model are both 0.1, or 10~\%. The scatter plot on the left side of Fig.~\ref{Case_1_Scatter} displays the model predicted values compared to the
true values. The dashed lines indicate the 95~\% confidence interval; that is, it is expected that 95~\% of the points should fall between these
lines, whose slopes are plus and minus 20~\% ($2\, \widetilde{\sigma}_M$) of the diagonal line. Of course, this plot cannot exist in a real situation, because the true
values are never known. Instead, the only way to present the data is via the scatter plot on the right side of Fig.~\ref{Case_1_Scatter}. Here, the measured values, $E_i$, are
compared with the predicted values, $M_i$. The same dashed lines are carried over from the plot on the left. Because the predicted values are being compared
with measurements that have uncertainty, it appears that the model uncertainty is greater than it actually is because the data points are now scattered noticeably beyond the
original uncertainty bounds. In this hypothetical example, the model is
assumed to be as accurate as the measurements, yet the comparison makes it seem as if the model is less accurate than the experiments. The procedure outlined
above, which makes use of only the measured and predicted values, is able to extract from the data the fact that the hypothetical model has a
relative error of 10~\%, not the roughly 15~\% that one would infer from the plot if the experimental uncertainty were not taken into account.

(Right) The same data, except now the predicted values are compared to measured values. On both plots, the uncertainty bounds apply to both
the predicted and measured values.}
\label{Case_1_Scatter}
\end{figure}


For the second example, the hypothetical model predictions and the experimental measurements are more realistic. Assume now that the
measured quantity is surface temperature, and that the relative uncertainty of the measured values, $\widetilde{\sigma}_E=0.07$, is obtained from Table~\ref{Uncertainty}.
We assume the model has a bias factor of 1.03 and its relative error is 0.10 in order to generate a set of hypothetical model predictions.
A graphical representation of the data is shown in Fig.~\ref{Case_2_Scatter}. Note that the
experimental uncertainty bounds are represented by solid lines, and the model bias and relative error are represented by the dashed lines.
Each are expressed as 95~\% confidence intervals ($2 \, \widetilde{\sigma}$).

experiments. The short dashed lines indicate the bias, $\delta=1.03$, and the relative error, $2\widetilde{\sigma}_M=0.20$, of the model predictions.

(Right) The same data, except now the predicted values are compared to measured values. On both plots, the uncertainty bounds are the same.}
\label{Case_2_Scatter}
\end{figure}

The statistical procedure outlined above ought to provide estimates of the bias factor, $\delta$, and standard deviation, $\widetilde{\sigma}_M$, for the
hypothetical model predictions. The results of seven random trials are shown in Table~\ref{trials}. For each trial, values representing the model
predictions and experimental measurements were randomly selected based on the assumed distributions. The calculation procedure discussed above was applied to these
hypothetical values. The resulting estimates of the model bias and relative error were not exactly the same as those used to generate the data
because the calculation procedure relies on truncated Taylor series approximations.
However, given the fact that the experimental uncertainty estimate,
$\widetilde{\sigma}_E$, is often only a gross approximation in its own right, the accuracy of the procedure is more than adequate, as indicated by the average values
of the seven trials.

\section{Limitations}

The above verification exercises are valuable in assuring that the procedure works as designed, but it also points out a few issues that need to be addressed. First, any
statistical procedure is based on the law of averages, or, in other words, more data is better than less. It is costly to conduct an extensive number of
fire experiments to assess the accuracy of the model; thus, sometimes there just is not enough data to apply the above statistical procedure.
Second, it has been assumed throughout the analysis that all of the relevant uncertainties can be characterized by normal distributions. Specifically, that the
values of $\ln (M/E)$ are normally distributed. What if they are not? An examination of the results of the NRC/EPRI validation study discussed above~\cite{NUREG_1824}
indicates that in cases where the number of pairs of $M$ and $E$ were greater than about 20, the values of $\ln (M/E)$ passed a test for normality\footnote{The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test for
normality was used with a $p$-value of 0.05. The $p$-value determines the probability of being incorrect in concluding that the data is not normally distributed.}, whereas when
there were less values, the values often did not pass the normality test. Figure~\ref{Normality} contains two sets of data for the model Fire Dynamics Simulator (FDS).
There were 124 point comparisons of wall temperature, for which $\ln (M/E)$ conforms quite well to a normal distribution. However, there were only 9 point comparisons
for plume temperature, for which $\ln (M/E)$ does not conform.

In cases where there is not enough data and/or the data cannot be considered normally distributed, it is preferable
to present the data as is shown in Figure~\ref{Normality} for Plume Temperature with only uncertainty bounds for the experiments, assuming the information is available.
The value of the validation process outlined above is that it is
possible at any step to stop and accept the raw output of the study as the basis for making an assessment of the model.
The uncertainty analysis is valid only to the extent that sufficient experimental data with quantified uncertainty estimates is available.

Wall Temperature indicate the $2 \widetilde{\sigma}$ bounds for the experiments (long dash) and the model (short dash).}
\label{Normality}
\end{figure}


Another concern with the above procedure is that an over-estimate of the experimental uncertainty, $\widetilde{\sigma}_E$, results in an under-estimate of the 
model uncertainty, $\widetilde{\sigma}_M$. Note that $\widehat{\widetilde{\sigma}_M}$ cannot be less than
$\widetilde{\sigma}_E$ because it is not possible to demonstrate that the model is more accurate than the measurements against which it is compared. This is not to say that the model
cannot be more accurate than the measurements; rather, that the model cannot be shown to be more accurate than the measurements. This rule is demonstrated
mathematically by Eq.~(\ref{stdev}) where it is observed that an over-estimate of the experimental uncertainty, $\widetilde{\sigma}_E$, can result in
the square root of a negative number, an imaginary number. In the case that the computed model uncertainty is less than the estimated experimental uncertainty, there are
two courses of action. First, it may be that the number of data points in the validation study is too small. If only a few model predictions are compared to corresponding
measurements, and the difference between the two is so small that the calculated model uncertainty is imaginary, then more data points should be collected
to determine if this remains the case. If it does, then 
the calculation of the experimental uncertainty, $\widetilde{\sigma}_E$, should be re-evaluated. The experimental uncertainties listed in
Table~\ref{Uncertainty} are based on the analysis of 26 experiments that were used in a particular validation study. If other experiments are used to evaluate the
model, these values need to be recalculated following the procedure presented by Hamins~\cite{NUREG_1824}.



\section{Conclusion}

A procedure has been proposed to estimate model uncertainty by way of comparisons of model predictions with experimental measurements whose uncertainty has been
quantified. For clarity of presentation, issues associated with the selection of experiments, metrics of comparison, and presentation of results, have not been
discussed in detail because these decisions are application-specific and best left to the end user or AHJ.
