The calculation of reaction enthalpy is tested by
heating up a thin slab made of one material that reacts
and forms a second material at a constant rate.
The change of enthalpy is zero below 80 C, where
the specific heat of the first material (MAT_A) suddenly drops
to one tenth. As a result, the reaction generates
a positive source term thus increasing the heating
rate. This is seen as a bump in the temperature
curve after 80 degC.
