\chapter{Preface}

This is Volume 3 of the FDS Technical Reference Guide. Volume 1 describes the mathematical model and numerical method. Volume 2 documents past and
present model verification work. Instructions for using FDS are contained in a separate User's Guide~\cite{FDS_Users_Guide}.

The FDS Technical Reference Guide is based in part on the ``Standard Guide for Evaluating the Predictive Capability of
Deterministic Fire Models,'' ASTM~E~1355~\cite{ASTM:E1355}. ASTM~E~1355 defines {\em model evaluation} as ``the process of quantifying the accuracy
of chosen results from a model when applied for a specific use.'' The model evaluation process consists of two main components: verification and
validation. {\em Verification} is a process to check the correctness of the solution of the governing equations. Verification does not imply that the
governing equations are appropriate; only that the equations are being solved correctly. {\em Validation} is a process to determine the
appropriateness of the governing equations as a mathematical model of the physical phenomena of interest. Typically, validation involves comparing
model results with experimental measurement. Differences that cannot be explained in terms of numerical errors in the model or uncertainty in the
measurements are attributed to the assumptions and simplifications of the physical model.

Evaluation is critical to establishing both the acceptable uses and limitations of a model. Throughout its development, FDS has undergone various
forms of evaluation, both at NIST and beyond. This volume provides a survey of validation work conducted to date to evaluate FDS.

\chapter{Acknowledgments}

\label{acksection}

FDS is supported financially via internal funding at both NIST and
VTT, Finland. In addition, support is provided by other agencies of
the US Federal Government:
\begin{itemize}
\item The US Nuclear Regulatory Commission Office of Research has funded key
validation experiments, the preparation of the FDS manuals, and the
development of various sub-models that are of importance in the area
of nuclear power plant safety. Special thanks to Mark Salley, David Stroup, and Jason
Dreisbach for their efforts and support.  The Office of Nuclear
Material Safety and Safeguards, another branch of the US NRC, has
supported modeling studies of tunnel fires under the direction of
Chris Bajwa and Allen Hansen.
\item The Micro-Gravity Combustion Program of the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration (NASA) has supported several projects that directly or indirectly benefited FDS development.
\item The US Forest Service has supported the development of sub-models in FDS designed to simulate the spread of
fire in the Wildland Urban Interface (WUI). Special thanks to Mark Finney and Tony Bova for their support.
\item The Minerals Management Service of the US Department of the Interior funded research at NIST aimed at
characterizing the burning behavior of oil spilled on the open sea or ice. Part of this research led to the development
of the ALOFT (A Large Outdoor Fire plume Trajectory) model, a forerunner of FDS. Special thanks to Joe Mullin for his
encouragement of the modeling efforts.
\end{itemize}
\noindent The following individuals and organizations played a role in the validation process of FDS.
\begin{itemize}
\item Anthony Hamins directed the NIST/NRC and WTC experiments, conducted smaller methane burner
measurements, and quantified the experimental uncertainty of these and other
experiments used in this study. Alex Maranghides was the Director of the Large Fire Laboratory at NIST at
the time these tests were conducted, and he helped to design the
experiments. Therese McAllister oversaw the instrumentation of the structural steel during the WTC experiments.
\item Anthony Hamins developed the technique of evaluating experimental uncertainty that is used throughout this Guide.
Blaza Toman of the Statistical Engineering Division of NIST developed the method of quantifying the
model error.
\item Rick Peacock of NIST assisted in the interpretation of results from
the ``NBS Multi-Room Test Series,'' a set of three room
fire experiments conducted at the National Bureau of Standards (now
NIST) in the mid-1980's.
\item Bryan Klein, currently employed at Thunderhead Engineering, Inc., assisted in the development of techniques to automatically generate the plots that
are found throughout this Guide.
\item Bill Pitts, Nelson Bryner, and Erik Johnsson of NIST contributed and interpreted test data for the
``NIST Reduced Scale Enclosure Experiments.''
\item Staff members of VTT, Finland, have contributed valuable experimental data,
referred to in this document as the ``VTT Large Hall Experiments.''
Also, Jukka Hietaniemi, Jukka Vaari and Timo Korhonen have
performed validation studies of various sub-models. The VTT Fire
Research group continues to work on model development and
validation of the model for various applications.
\item David Sheppard, currently of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF), conducted the
experiments referred to as the ``UL/NFPRF Test Series'' on behalf of the Fire Protection Research Foundation (then known as
the National Fire Protection Research Foundation) while working at Underwriters Labs in Northbrook, Illinois.
Sheppard, along with Bryan Klein, currently employed at Thunderhead Engineering, Inc., conducted the experiments referred to as the ``ATF Corridors'' series in 2008.
\item Jerry Back, Craig Beyler and Phil DiNenno of Hughes Associates and Pat Tatem of
the Naval Research Laboratory contributed
experimental data for the ``HAI/NRL Wall Fire'' series. Thanks also to Craig Beyler for assistance with the data
for the ``Beyler Hood Experiments.''
\item Ken Steckler provided details about the ``Steckler Compartment Experiments'' of 1979.
\item Jianping Zhang at the University of Ulster contributed heat flux measurements from the SBI apparatus.
\item At the University of Maryland, Professor Fred~Mowrer and Phil Friday
were the first to apply FDS to the NRC-sponsored experiments referred
to in this document as the ``FM/SNL Test Series'' (Factory Mutual and
Sandia National Laboratories conducted these experiments).
\item Steve Nowlen of Sandia National Laboratory provided valuable information about the FM/SNL series, and he also conducted the CAROLFIRE experiments.
\item Ulf Wickstr\"{o}m of SP, Sweden, contributed experimental data from a series of experiments (SP 2009 AST) that were designed to
evaluate the feasibility of using plate thermometer measurements as boundary conditions for a heat conduction calculation within several types of
steel beams. The adiabatic surface temperature concept was tested in both the experiments and model.
\item Jeremy Thornock at the University of Utah provided data on the Sandia helium plume.
\item Sheldon Teiszen at Sandia National Laboratories, Albuquerque, provided detailed statistics for the helium plume and pool fire experiments conducted in the Sandia FLAME facility.
\item Taylor Myers, a student at the University of Maryland and a Summer Undergraduate Research Fellow (SURF) at NIST, analyzed the
Vettori Flat and Sloped Ceiling sprinkler experiments. Thanks also to Bob Vettori of the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission and formerly of NIST for his
