<h2>Getting Started using FDS/Smokeview Build Scripts</h2>
<hr size="1">

<h3>Initial Setup</h3>

<ul>
<li>Setting up environment definitions
<ol>
<li>Open the <tt>Utilities\Scripts</tt> folder and double-click on the file <tt>COPY_fds_smv_env.bat</tt>. 
This copies <tt>fds-smv_env.bat</tt> to your home directory.
<li>Open a command shell and type: <tt>notepad fds_smv_env.bat</tt>
<li>Define your FDS/Smokeview repository location.
</ol>
<p><li>Compilers
<ol>
<li>Install Intel Fortran.  Intel C/C++ only needs to be installed if you wish to build Smokeview.
<p><li>Putty - a program used login to a remote Linux or Mac computer.
<ol>
<li>Install putty.  Doesn't matter where - just make sure the install directory is in the <em>path</em> .<br> 
Test the installation by opening up a command shell and typing <tt>plink</tt> at the command line. 
<li>Set up ssh keys to let you login to the Linux cluster without a password.  Basically you create a public/private pair 
of ssh keys.  You copy the private key to somewhere on your PC (doesn't matter where) 
and copy the public key into a file on the Linux cluster.  More precisely:
<ol>
<li>run puttygen
<li>click on the <tt>SSH-2 RSA</tt> radio button
<li>click on the <tt>Generate</tt> button.  Pick a <em>pass-phrase</em> that you can easily remember.
<li>Save the private key into the <tt>c:\bin\keys</tt> directory
<li>Save the public key and copy it to the Linux cluster.  Put the key at the end of the file <tt>authorized_key2</tt> which
is located in the <tt>.ssh</tt> directory (in your home directory)
</ol>
<li>On your PC, copy the file <tt>Pageant.exe</tt> to <tt>C:\Documents and Settings\gforney\Start Menu\Programs\Startup</tt> 
(change <tt>gforney</tt> to your user name).  
<li>Reboot your computer.
<li>Open <tt>Pageant</tt> (an icon looking like looking like a terminal wearing a black hat should 
appear in the right side of the task bar).
This program will direct you to open your private key and ask you for the pass-phrase used to create it. 
</ol>
<p><li>Uploading files to googlecode with Python
<p><a href="http://www.python.org/">Download and install Python</a>
<p><li>Google password file
<p>Create a file named <tt>gc.passwd</tt> containing your google password and put it in your windows home directory.
<p><li>Winzip
<ol>
<li>Install Winzip version 12, Winzip command line tool and Winzip self extractor.  
Note, The Winzip command line tool is free but is a separate download from Winzip 12.  
The Winzip self extractor needs to be purchased separately.
<li>Put winzip tools in <tt>c:\bin\winzip</tt>
</ol>
</ul>

<h3>Testing the Setup</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="../SMV/scripts/SHOW_setup.bat">Show configuration settings</tt></a> 
<li><a href="../SMV/scripts/TEST2_setup.bat">Test prerequisites</a> 
</ul>

<h3>Using the Scripts</h3>
After the environment has been defined and the necessary software has been installed, the script pages below may be used to build
FDS, Smokeview or other components (presently just the Verification cases).
