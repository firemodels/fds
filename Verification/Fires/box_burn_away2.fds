&HEAD CHID='box_burn_away2', TITLE='Test BURN_AWAY feature' / 

The FOAM box is evaporated away by the high thermal radiation
from HOT surfaces. The mass of the box is 0.4^3 m3 * 20 kg/m3 = 1.28 kg.
This should be compared to the final value of fuel density volume integral, 
computed by the first DEVC.

The gas species here is additional SPEC.
