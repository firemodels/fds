These spectra of water were reported in Applied Spectroscopy 50, 1047 1996.
The n and k files contain the spectra of the real and imaginary refractive index, respectively.
DC, DL and Em files contain the real dielectric constant, imaginary dielectric constant or dielectric loss, and (decadic) molar absorption coefficient or molar absorptivity or Beer-Lambert absorption coefficient (units L /mole-cm), respectively
