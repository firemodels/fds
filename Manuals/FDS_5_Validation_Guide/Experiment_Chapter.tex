\chapter{Description of Experiments}

\label{Experiments_Chapter}

This chapter contains a brief description of the experiments that were used for model validation. Only enough detail is included here to provide a
general understanding of the model simulations. Anyone wishing to use the experimental measurements for validation ought to consult the cited test reports for a
comprehensive description.



\section{VTT Large Hall Tests}

The experiments are described in Ref.~\cite{Hostikka:VTT2104}. The series consisted of 8 experiments, but because of replicates only three unique fire
scenarios. The experiments were undertaken to study the movement of smoke in a large hall with a sloped ceiling. The tests were conducted inside the
VTT Fire Test Hall, with dimensions of 19~m high by 27~m long by 14~m wide. Each test involved a single heptane pool fire, ranging from 2~MW to 4~MW.
Four types of predicted output were used in the present evaluation -- the HGL temperature and depth, average flame height and the plume
temperature. Three vertical arrays of thermocouples (TC), plus two thermocouples in the plume, were compared to FDS predictions. The HGL
temperature and height were reduced from an average of the three TC
arrays using the standard algorithm described in
Chapter~\ref{HGL:Chapter}. The ceiling jet temperature was not
considered, because the ceiling in the test hall is not flat, and the
standard model algorithm is not appropriate for this geometry.

The VTT test report lacks some information needed to model the experiments, which is why some information was based on private communications with the
principal investigator, Simo Hostikka.
\begin{description}
\item[Surface Materials:] The walls and ceiling of the test hall consist of a 1~mm thick layer of sheet metal on top of a 5~cm layer of
mineral wool. The floor was constructed of concrete. The report does not provide thermal properties of these materials.
\item[Natural Ventilation:] In Cases~1 and 2, all doors were closed, and ventilation was restricted to infiltration through the building envelope. Precise
information on air infiltration during these tests is not available. The scientists who conducted the experiments recommend a leakage area of about 2~m$^2$,
distributed uniformly throughout the enclosure. By contrast, in Case~3, the doors located in each end wall (Doors 1 and 2, respectively)
were open to the external ambient environment. These doors are each 0.8~m wide by 4~m high, and are located such that their centers
are 9.3~m from the south wall.
\item[Mechanical Ventilation:] The test hall has a single mechanical exhaust duct, located in the roof space, running along the center of the building. This
duct had a circular section with a diameter of 1~m, and opened horizontally to the hall at a distance of 12~m from the floor and 10.5~m from the west wall.
Mechanical exhaust ventilation was operational for Case~3, with a constant volume flow rate of 11~m$^3$/s drawn through
the exhaust duct.
\item[Heat Release Rate:] Each test used a single liquid fuel pan with its center located 16~m from the west
wall and 7.4~m from the south wall. For all tests, the fuel was heptane in a circular steel pan that was partially filled with water. The
pan had a diameter of 1.17~m for Case~1 and 1.6~m for Cases~2 and 3. In each case, the fuel surface was 1~m above the
floor. The trays were placed on load cells, and the HRR was calculated from the mass loss rate. For the three cases,
the fuel mass loss rate was averaged from individual replicate tests. In the HRR estimation, the heat of combustion (taken as 44,600~kJ/kg) and the
combustion efficiency for n-heptane was used. Hostikka suggests a value of 0.8 for the combustion efficiency.
Tewarson reports a value of 0.93 for a 10~cm pool fire~\cite{SFPE:Tewarson}. For the calculations reported in the current
study, a combustion efficiency of 0.85 is assumed. In general, an uncertainty of 15~\% has been assumed for the reported HRR of most of the large
scale fire experiments used.
\item[Radiative Fraction:] The radiative fraction was assumed to be 0.35, similar to many smoky hydrocarbons.

\section{UL/NFPRF Sprinkler, Vent, and Draft Curtain Study}
\label{UL_NFPRF_Description}

In January, 1997, a series of 22 heptane spray burner experiments was conducted at the Large Scale Fire Test Facility at Underwriters Laboratories
(UL) in Northbrook, Illinois~\cite{Sheppard:1}. The objective of the experiments was to characterize the temperature and flow field for fire
scenarios with a controlled heat release rate in the presence of sprinklers, draft curtains and a single smoke \& heat vent.
The Large Scale Fire Test Facility at UL contains a 37~m by 37~m (120~ft by 120~ft) main fire test cell, equipped with a 30.5~m by 30.5~m (100~ft by
100~ft) adjustable height ceiling. The layout of the experiments is shown in Fig.~\ref{layout}. One 1.2~m by 2.4~m (4~ft by 8~ft) vent was installed
among 49 upright sprinklers on a 3~m by 3~m (10~ft by 10~ft) spacing.

\end{figure}

\begin{description}
\item[Ceiling:] The ceiling was raised to a height of 7.6~m and instrumented with thermocouples and other measurement devices. The ceiling was constructed of
0.6~m by 1.2~m by 1.6~cm UL fire-rated Armstrong Ceramaguard (Item 602B) ceiling tiles. The manufacturer reported the
thermal properties of the material to be: specific heat 753 J/(kg$\cdot$K), thermal conductivity
0.0611~W/(m$\cdot$K), and density 313~kg/m$^3$.
\item[Draft Curtains:] Sheet metal, 1.2~mm thick and 1.8~m deep, was suspended from the ceiling for 16 of the 22 tests, enclosing an area of about 450~m$^2$ and 49 sprinklers.
\item[Sprinklers:] Central ELO-231 (Extra Large Orifice) uprights were used for all the tests. The orifice diameter of this sprinkler is reported by the manufacturer to be
nominally 1.6~cm (0.64~in), the reference actuation temperature is reported by the manufacturer to be 74$^\circ$C (165$^\circ$F). The RTI (Response Time
Index) and C-factor (Conductivity factor) were reported by UL to be 148~(m$\cdot$s)$^\ha$ and 0.7~(m/s)$^\ha$, respectively~\cite{Sheppard:1}.
When installed, the sprinkler deflector was located 8~cm below the ceiling. The thermal
element of the sprinkler was located 11~cm below the ceiling. The sprinklers were installed with nominal 3~m by 3~m (exact 10~ft by 10~ft) spacing in a
system designed to deliver a constant 0.34~L/(s$\cdot$m$^2$) (0.50 gpm/ft$^2$) discharge density when supplied by a 131~kPa (19~psi) discharge
pressure
\item[Vent:] A single UL listed double leaf fire vent with steel covers and steel curb was installed in the adjustable height ceiling in the position shown in
Fig.~\ref{layout}. The vent is designed to open manually or automatically. The vent doors were recessed into the ceiling about 0.3~m (1~ft).
\item[Heat Release Rate:] The heptane spray burner consisted of a 1~m by 1~m square of 1.3~cm pipe supported by four cement blocks 0.6~m off the floor.
Four atomizing spray nozzles were used to provide a free spray of heptane that was then ignited. For all but one of the tests, the total heat release
rate from the fire was manually ramped up following a ``t-squared'' curve to a steady-state in 75~s
(150~s was used in Test I-16). The fire growth curve was followed until a specified fire size was
reached or the first sprinkler activated. After either of these events, the fire size was maintained at that level until conditions reached roughly a
steady state, {\em i.e.} the temperatures recorded near the ceilings remained steady and no more sprinkler activations occurred.
The heat release rate from the burner was confirmed by placing it under the large product calorimeter at UL, ramping up the flow of heptane in the
same manner as in the tests, and measuring the total and convective heat release rates. It was found that the convective heat release rate was
0.65$\pm$0.02 of the total.
\item[Instrumentation:] The instrumentation for the tests consisted of thermocouples, gas analysis equipment, and pressure transducers. The locations of the instrumentation
are referenced in the plan view of the facility (Fig.~\ref{layout}).
Temperature measurements were recorded at 104 locations. Type K 0.0625~in diameter Inconel sheathed thermocouples were positioned to measure (i)
temperatures near the ceiling, (ii) temperatures of the ceiling jet, and (iii) temperatures near the vent.

\section{NIST/NRC Test Series}

These experiments, sponsored by the US NRC and conducted at NIST, consisted of 15 large-scale experiments performed in June 2003. All 15 tests were
included in the validation study. The experiments are documented in Ref.~\cite{Hamins:SP1013-1}. The fire sizes ranged from 350 kW to 2.2 MW in a compartment with dimensions
21.7~m by 7.1~m by 3.8~m high, designed to represent a compartment in a nuclear power plant containing power and control cables.
The walls and ceiling were covered with two layers of marinate boards, each layer 0.0125~m thick. The floor
was covered with one layer of gypsum board on top of a layer of plywood. Thermo-physical and optical properties of the marinate
and other materials used in the compartment are given in Ref.~\cite{Hamins:SP1013-1}. The room had one door and a mechanical air injection and extraction
system. Ventilation conditions, the fire size, and fire location were varied. Numerous measurements (approximately 350 per test) were made including
gas and surface temperatures, heat fluxes and gas velocities.

Following are some notes provided by Anthony Hamins, who conducted the experiments:
\begin{description}
\item[Natural Ventilation:] The compartment had a 2~m by 2~m door in the middle of the west wall. Some of the tests had a closed door and no mechanical
ventilation (Tests 2, 7, 8, 13, and 17), and in those tests the measured compartment leakage was an important consideration. The test report lists leakage
areas based on measurements performed prior to Tests 1, 2, 7, 8, and 13. For the closed door tests, the leakage area used in the simulations was
based on the last available measurement. The chronological order of the tests differed from the numerical order.
For Test 4, the leakage area measured before Test 2 was used. For Tests 10 and 16, the leakage area
measured before Test 7 was used.
\item[Mechanical Ventilation:] The mechanical ventilation and exhaust was used during Tests 4, 5, 10, and 16, providing about 5 air changes per hour. The
door was closed during Test 4 and open during Tests 5, 10, and 16. The supply duct was positioned on the south wall, about 2~m off the floor. An
exhaust duct of equal area to the supply duct was positioned on the opposite wall at a comparable location. The flow rates through the supply and
exhaust ducts were measured in detail during breaks in the testing, in the absence of a fire. During the tests, the flows were monitored with single
bi-directional probes during the tests themselves.
\item[Heat Release Rate:] A single nozzle was used to spray liquid hydrocarbon fuels onto a 1~m by 2~m fire pan that was about 0.1~m deep. The test plan
originally called for the use of two nozzles to provide the fuel spray. Experimental observation suggested that the fire was less unsteady with the
use of a single nozzle. In addition, it was observed that the actual extent of the liquid pool was well-approximated by a 1~m circle in the
center of the pan. For safety reasons, the fuel flow was terminated when the lower-layer oxygen concentration
dropped to approximately 15~\% by volume.
The fuel used in 14 of the tests was heptane, while toluene was used for one test. The HRR was
determined using oxygen consumption calorimetry. The recommended uncertainty values
were 17~\% for all of the tests.
\item[Radiative Fraction:]  The value of the radiative fraction and its
uncertainty were reported as 0.44 and 0.40 for heptane and toluene, respectively.

\section{WTC Spray Burner Test Series}

As part of its investigation of the World Trade Center disaster, the Building and Fire Research Laboratory at NIST conducted several series of fire experiments to both gain insight into the
observed fire behavior and also to validate FDS for use in reconstructing the fires. The first series of experiments involved a relatively simple compartment with a liquid spray burner and
various structural elements with varying amounts of sprayed fire-resistive materials (SFRM).
A complete description of the experiments can be found in the NIST WTC report NCSTAR~1-5B~\cite{NIST_NCSTAR_1-5B}.
The overall enclosure was rectangular, as were the vents and most of the obstructions. The compartment walls and ceiling were made of 2.54~cm thick marinite. The manufacturer provided the thermal properties of the material used in the calculation. The density was 737~kg/m$^3$, conductivity 0.12~W/m/K. The specific heat ranged from 1.17~kJ/kg/K at 93~$^\circ$C to
1.42~kJ/kg/K at 425~$^\circ$C. This value was assumed for higher temperatures.
The steel used to construct the column and truss flanges was 0.64~cm thick.  The density of the steel was assumed to be 7,860~kg/m$^3$; its specific heat 0.45~kJ/kg/K.

Two fuels were used in the tests. The properties of the fuels were obtained from measurements made on a series of unconfined burns that are referenced in the test report.
The first fuel was a blend of heptane isomers, C$_7$H$_{16}$. Its soot yield was set at a constant 1.5~\%. The second fuel was a mixture (40~\% - 60~\% by volume) of toluene, C$_7$H$_8$,
and heptane. Because FDS only considers the burning of a single hydrocarbon fuel, the mixture was taken to be C$_7$H$_{12}$ with a soot yield of 11.2~\%.
The radiative fraction for the heptane blend was 0.44; for the heptane/toluene mixture it was 0.39.
The heat release rate of the simulated burner was set to that which was measured in the experiments. The spray burner was modeled using reported properties of the nozzle and
liquid fuel droplets.





\section{FM/SNL Test Series}

The Factory Mutual and Sandia National Laboratories (FM/SNL) test series was a series of 25 fire
tests conducted in 1985 for the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) by Factory Mutual Research Corporation (FMRC), under
the direction of Sandia National Laboratories (SNL)~\cite{Nowlen:NUREG4681,Nowlen:NUREG4527}. The primary purpose of these tests was to
provide data with which to validate computer models for various types of compartments typical of nuclear power plants. The
experiments were conducted in an enclosure measuring approximately 18~m long x 12~m wide x 6~m high, constructed at the FMRC fire test facility in Rhode Island.
All of the tests involved forced ventilation to simulate typical power plant operations. Four of
the tests were conducted with a full-scale control room mockup in place. Parameters varied
during the experiments included fire intensity, enclosure ventilation rate, and fire location.

The current study used data from three experiments (Tests 4, 5, and 21). In these tests, the fire
source was a propylene gas burner with a diameter of approximately 0.9 m, with its rim
located approximately 0.1 m above the floor. For Tests 4 and 5, the burner was positioned on the longitudinal axis centerline, 6.1 m from
the nearest wall. For Test 21, the fire source was placed within a simulated electrical
cabinet.

Following is supplemental information provided by the test director, Steve Nowlen of Sandia National Laboratory:
\begin{description}
\item[Heat Release Rate:] The HRR was determined using oxygen consumption calorimetry in the exhaust stack with
a correction applied for the carbon dioxide in the upper layer of the compartment. The
uncertainty of the fuel mass flow was not documented. All three tests selected for this study had
the same target peak heat release rate of 516~kW following a 4~min ``t-squared'' growth
profile. The test report contains time histories of the measured HRR, for which the average,
sustained HRR following the ramp up for Tests 4, 5, and 21 have been estimated as 510~kW, 480~kW, and 470~kW, respectively.
Once reached, the peak HRR was maintained essentially constant
during a steady-burn period of 6~min in Tests~4 and 5, and 16~min in Test~21. Note that in Test 21, Nowlen reports a
``significant'' loss of effluent from the exhaust hood that could lead to an under-estimate of the HRR towards the end of the experiment.
\item[Radiative Fraction:] The radiative fraction was not measured during the experiment, but
in this study it is assumed to equal 0.35, which is typical for a smoky hydrocarbons.
It was further assumed that the radiative fraction was about the same in
Test~21 as the other tests, as fuel burning must have occurred outside of the electrical cabinet in
which the burner was placed.
\item[Measurements:] Four types of measurements were conducted during the FM/SNL test series that are used in the
current model evaluation study, including the HGL temperature and depth, and the ceiling jet and
plume temperatures. Aspirated thermocouples (TCs) were used to make all of the temperature
measurements. Generally, aspirated TC measurements are preferable to bare-bead TC measurements,
as systematic radiative exchange measurement error is reduced.
\item[HGL Depth and Temperature:] Data from all of the vertical TC trees were used when reducing
the HGL height and temperature. For the FM/SNL Tests 4 and 5, Sectors 1, 2, and 3 were used,
all weighted evenly. For Test 21, Sectors 1 and 3 were used, evenly weighted. Sector 2 was
partially within the fire plume in Test 21.

\section{NBS Multi-Room Test Series}

The National Bureau of Standards (NBS, which is now called the National Institute of Standards
and Technology, NIST) Multi-Room Test Series consisted of 45 fire tests representing
9 different sets of conditions were conducted in a three-room suite. The experiments were
conducted in 1985 and are described in detail in Ref.~\cite{Peacock:NBS_Multi-Room}. The suite consisted of two relatively
small rooms, connected via a relatively long corridor. The fire source, a gas burner, was located
against the rear wall of one of the small compartments.
Fire tests of 100~kW, 300~kW and 500~kW were conducted. For the current study, only three 100~kW fire experiments have been used,
including Test~100A from Set~1, Test~100O from Set~2, and Test~100Z from Set~4. These tests
were selected because they had been used in prior validation studies, and because these tests had the
steadiest values of measured heat release rate during the steady-burn period.

Following is additional information provided by the test director, Richard Peacock of NIST:
\begin{description}
\item[Heat Release Rate:] In the two tests for which
the door was open, the HRR during the steady-burn period measured via oxygen consumption
calorimetry was 110~kW with an uncertainty of about 15~\%, consistent with the replicate
measurements made during the experimental series and the uncertainty typical of oxygen
consumption calorimetry. It was assumed that the closed door test (Test~100O) had the same HRR as the open
door tests.
\item[Radiative Fraction:] Natural gas was used as the fuel in
Test~100A. In Tests~100O and 100Z, acetylene was added to the natural gas to increase the
smoke yield, and as a consequence, the radiative fraction increased. The radiative fraction of
natural gas has been studied previously, whereas the radiative fraction of the acetylene/natural
gas mixture has not been studied. The radiative fraction for the natural gas fire was assigned a
value of 0.20, whereas a value of 0.30 was assigned for the natural gas/acetylene fires.
\item[Measurements:] Only two types of measurements conducted during the NBS test series were used in the
evaluation considered here, because there was less confidence in the other measurements.
The measurements considered here were the HGL temperature and depth, in which bare bead
TCs were used to make these measurements. Single point measurements of temperature within
the burn room were not used in the evaluation of plume or ceiling jet algorithms. This is because
the geometry was not consistent in either case with the assumptions used in the model algorithms
of plumes or jets. Specifically, the burner was mounted against a wall, and the room width-to-height
ratio was less than that assumed by the various ceiling jet correlations.

\section{Steckler Compartment Experiments}

Steckler, Quintiere and Rinkinen performed a set of 55 compartment fire tests at NBS in 1979. The compartment was 2.8~m by 2.8~m by 2.13~m high\footnote{The test report
gives the height of the compartment as 2.18~m. This is a misprint. The compartment was 2.13~m high.}, with a single door of
various widths, or alternatively a single window with various heights. A 30~cm diameter methane burner was used to generate fires with heat release rates of
31.6~kW, 62.9~kW, 105.3~kW and 158~kW. Vertical profiles of velocity and temperature were measured in the doorway, along with a single vertical profile of temperature
within the compartment.
A full description and results are reported in Reference~\cite{Steckler:NBSIR_82-2520}. The basic test matrix is listed in Table~\ref{Steckler_Table}. Note that the
test report does not include a detailed description of the compartment. However, an internal report\footnote{ {\em Technical Research Report, Fire Induced Flows
Through Room Openings - Flow Coefficients}, Project 203005-003, Armstrong Cork Company, Lancaster, Pennsylvania, May, 1981.} by the test sponsor, Armstrong Cork Company,
reports that the compartment floor was composed of 19~mm calcium silicate board on top of 12.7~mm plywood on wood joists. The walls and ceiling consisted of
12.7~mm ceramic fiber insulation board over 0.66~mm aluminum sheet attached to wood studs.

\section{SP Adiabatic Surface Temperature Experiments}

In 2008, three compartment experiments were performed at SP Technical Research Institute of Sweden under the sponsorship of Brandforsk, the Swedish Fire Research Board~\cite{Wickstrom_AST}. The
objective of the experiments was to demonstrate how plate thermometer measurements in the vicinity of a simple steel beam can be used to supply the boundary conditions
for a multi-dimensional heat conduction calculation for the beam. The adiabatic surface temperature was derived from the plate temperatures and used by TASEF, a finite-element
thermal-structural program.

The experiments were performed inside a standard compartment designed for corner fire testing (ISO 9705).
The compartment is 3.6~m deep, 2.4~m wide and 2.4~m high and includes a door opening 0.8~m by 2.0~m. The room was constructed of 20~cm thick light weight concrete
blocks with a density of 600~kg/m$^3$ $\pm 100$~kg/m$^3$.
The heat source was a gas burner run at a constant power of 450~kW. The top of the burner, with a square opening 30~cm by 30~cm, was placed 65~cm above the floor, 2.5~cm from the walls.
A single steel beam was suspended 20~cm below the ceiling
along the centerline of the compartment. There were three measurement stations along the beam at lengths of 0.9~m (Position A), 1.8~m (Position B), and
2.7~m (Position C) from the far wall where the fire was either positioned in the corner (Tests 1 and 2), or the center (Test 3). The beam in Test 1 was
a rectangular steel tube filled with an insulation material. The beam in Tests 2 and 3 was an I-beam.

\clearpage

\section{McCaffrey Plume Experiments}

In 1979, at the National Bureau of Standards (now NIST), Bernard McCaffrey measured centerline temperature and velocity profiles above a porous,
refractory burner. There were five distinct heat release rates, ranging from 14~kW to 57~kW. The fuel was natural gas. The burner was square, 0.3~m on each side.
The results of the experiments are reported in Reference~\cite{McCaffrey:NBSIR_79-1910}.


\section{Smyth Slot Burner Experiment}

Kermit Smyth {\em et al.} conducted diffusion flame experiments at NIST using a methane/air Wolfhard-Parker slot burner.  The experiments are described in
detail in Refs.~\cite{Norton:1,Smyth:1}.  The Wolfhard-Parker slot burner consists of an 8~mm wide
central slot flowing fuel surrounded by two 16~mm wide slots flowing dry air with 1~mm separations between the slots.
The slots are 41~mm in length.  Measurements were made of all major species and a number of minor species along with temperature
and velocity.  Experimental uncertainties have been reported as 5~\% for temperature  and 10~\% to 20~\%
for the major species.


\section{Beyler Hood Experiments}

Craig Beyler performed a large number of experiments involving a variety of fuels, fire sizes, burner diameters, and
burner distances beneath a hood~\cite{Beyler:Hood}.  The hood consisted of concentric cylinders separated
by an air gap.  The inner cylinder was shorter than the outer and this allowed combustion products to be removed
uniformly from the hood perimeter.  The exhaust gases were then analyzed to determine species concentrations.
The burner could be raised and lowered with respect to the bottom edge of the hood.  Based on the published
measurement uncertainties, species errors are estimated at 6~\%.


\section{NIST Reduced Scale Enclosure Experiments}

The CO production test series used the NIST Reduced Scale Enclosure (RSE)~\cite{Bryner:1}.  The RSE is a
40~\% scaled version of the ISO 9705 compartment.
It measures 0.98 m wide by 1.46 m deep by 0.98 m tall.  The compartment contains a door centered on the small
face that measures 0.48 m wide by 0.81 m tall.  A 15 cm diameter natural gas burner was positioned in the
center of the compartment.  The burner was on a stand so that its top was 15~cm above the floor.
Species measurements were made inside the upper layer of the compartment at the front near the door
and near the rear of the compartment.


\section{Hamins Methane Burner Experiments}

Anthony Hamins {\em et al.} performed a series of tests on circular gas
burners measuring the radial and vertical radiative heat flux profiles
outside the flame region. The tests are described
in~\cite{Hostikka:3}. Tests at three burner diameters, 0.10 m, 0.38 m
and 1.0 m are used for validation.


\section{NRL/HAI Wall Heat Flux Measurements}

Back, Beyler, DiNenno and Tatem~\cite{Back:IAFSS4} measured the heat flux from 9 different sized propane fires set up against a wall composed
of gypsum board. The experiments were sponsored by the Naval Research Laboratory and conducted by Hughes Associates, Inc., of Baltimore, Maryland. The
square sand burner ranged in size from 0.28~m to 0.70~m, and the fires ranged in size from 50~kW to 520~kW.

\section{Ulster SBI Corner Heat Flux Measurements}

Zhang {\em et al.}~\cite{Zhang:IAFSS9} measured the heat flux and flame heights from
fires in the single burning item (SBI) enclosure at the University of Ulster, Northern Ireland.
Thin steel plate probes were used to measure the surface heat flux, and flame
heights were determined by analyzing the instantaneous images extracted from the videos of the
experiments by a CCD camera. Three heat release rates were used -- 30~kW, 45~kW, and 60~kW.

\section{INERIS Hydrogen Dispersion Experiment}

A series of experiments was conducted by the Institut National de l'Environnement Industriel et des Risques (INERIS)~\cite{INERIS} to study the release of small amounts of hydrogen in
a confined space. The experimental setup consisted of a 1~g/s vertical hydrogen release for 240~s from an orifice of 20~mm
diameter in a rectangular room (garage) of dimensions 3.78~m by 7.2~m by 2.88~m. Two small openings (50~mm diameter) at the front
and bottom side of the room assured constant pressure conditions. Hydrogen concentrations were measured as a function of time
during both the release phase and the subsequent diffusion phase (5160~s) at various heights in the garage.

\chapter{Quantifying Model Error}

As fire models become more widely used in fire protection engineering, people naturally want to know how reliable the fire model predictions are.
There are two reasons why a model prediction might be less than reliable -- error intrinsic to the model itself or uncertainty in the measured or postulated input parameters.
Notice that we have used the word {\em uncertainty} in regard to the model inputs, and {\em error} in regards to the model itself. The reason for this is two-fold. For one,
it helps to differentiate various terms that are used to quantify model accuracy; but, more importantly, it highlights the subtle distinction between the roles of the model
and of the modeler. For example, if the modeler chooses 10~MW to be the heat release rate of a hypothetical fire, we do not say it is wrong, but rather uncertain because there
is no easy way to know for sure just how big the fire is going to be. The model, on the other hand, includes assumptions and approximations that make its predictions less
accurate for the sake of practicality. If the model is well-designed, the error associated with its formulation will be relatively small. Exactly how small is the subject of
this chapter.

\section{The Validation Process}

A fire model validation study typically consists of comparing a point measurements made during a compartment fire experiment with corresponding model predictions.
Figure~\ref{temp_history} is a typical result of such an exercise, and given that usually dozens of point measurements are made during each experiment,
and potentially dozens of experiments can be conducted, we can expect to see hundreds of such plots for a given quantity of interest. In many cases, these
plots in themselves provide sufficient information for a potential model user or authority having jurisdiction (AHJ) to decide if the model is sufficiently accurate for the
given application. Because there is no consensus ``acceptance criteria'' within the fire protection community to indicate what constitutes sufficient accuracy, the
judgment is left to end user or AHJ. It can be argued that this is as it should be because each application is different. For example, some regulatory
authorities prefer models that consistently over-predict the severity of the fire, and as such the model can serve as a ``screening tool.'' Design engineers, however,
usually want the model to predict quantities of interest as accurately as possible, even though they may apply some form of safety factor to the results.
In any case, there is certainly no reason why we cannot develop some easy to use process to quantify the accuracy of the model that goes beyond simply
publishing hundreds of plots like the one shown in Fig.~\ref{temp_history}.

To this end, we first have to decide how to condense all the data represented by these plots into a more tractable form. Specifically, we
have to decide on a metric with which to compare two curves like the ones shown in Fig.~\ref{temp_history}. Peacock and
Babrauskas~\cite{Peacock:FSJ} discuss various possible metrics. The most commonly used metric is simply to compare the peak measured value over ambient against the peak
predicted value over ambient. If the data is spiky, some form of time-averaging can be used. Regardless of the exact form of the metric, what results from
this exercise is a pair of numbers for each plot, $(E_i,M_i)$, that can be depicted graphically as shown in Fig.~\ref{scatterplot}. Now, at least, we have
condensed hundreds of plots into just one, but we still have the problem of quantifying the degree of scatter in the results. At this point in the analysis, the
diagonal line on the plot shown in Fig.~\ref{scatterplot} only indicates where a prediction and measurement agree. But because the model has error, and
the measurement has uncertainty, it cannot be said that the model is perfect if its predictions agree exactly with measurements. There needs to be a way of quantifying
both the error and uncertainty before any conclusions can be drawn.
Such an exercise would result in the error/uncertainty bars shown in the figure. At first glance, it would appear that the
horizontal bar associated with each point represents the uncertainty in the measurement, and the vertical bar represents the error in the model. Unfortunately, it
is not a simple task to quantify these values, nor can it be said that the vertical bar is the result solely of model error. As will be discussed below, any
experiment involves measurements of elevated temperatures, heat flux, and so on, resulting from the fire, but also measurements of parameters, like the
heat release rate and material properties, that are then fed into the model as input. Uncertainty in these input parameters combines with the error in the model
itself to form the vertical bar associated with each point in Fig.~\ref{scatterplot}. Decoupling these two is the subject of analysis below. Before presenting this
analysis, however, we must first discuss in more detail the various forms of uncertainty and error.


\section{Model Error}

FDS is a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model, meaning that it is essentially a numerical algorithm that solves the Navier-Stokes equations.
However, FDS does not actually solve the Navier-Stokes equations, but rather an approximate form of these equations. The approximation involves simplifying
physical assumptions, like the low-Mach number approximation and the large eddy simulation (LES) technique of representing subgrid-scale turbulence.
But the most critical approximation is the discretization of the governing equations. For example, the partial derivative of the density, $\rho$,
with respect to the coordinate direction, $x$, is written in approximate form as:
\be \frac{\partial \rho}{\partial x} = \frac{\rho_{i+1} - \rho_{i-1}}{2 \, \dx} + \mathcal{O}(\dx^2) \ee
where $\dx$ is the grid spacing chosen by the model user.
The second term on the right represents all the terms of order $\dx^2$ and higher in the Taylor series expansion and are known collectively as the
{\em discretization error}. These extra terms are simply dropped from
the equation set, the argument being that they become smaller and smaller with decreasing grid cell size, $\dx$. The effect of these neglected terms is captured, to
some extent, by the subgrid-scale turbulence model, but that is yet another approximation of the real thing. What effect do these approximations have on
the predicted results? It is very difficult to determine based on an analysis of the discretized equations. At best, one can demonstrate convergence towards some
analytical solution of the non-turbulent Navier-Stokes equations at a rate determined by the spatial and temporal differencing schemes, but this still does not answer a
question like, ``What is the error of an FDS prediction of the gas temperature at a particular location in the room at a particular point in time?''

To make matters worse, there are literally dozens of subroutines that make up FDS, from its radiation solver, solid phase heat transfer routines, pyrolysis model,
empirical mass, momentum and energy transfer routines at the wall, and so on. A careful, systematic error analysis of the combination of all these routines is
nearly impossible. Indeed the complexity of the analysis would approach that of FDS itself. For this reason, we rely on comparisons of FDS predictions to as many
experiments as possible as a means of quantifying model error. That is the primary focus of this entire guide, and the first step in the process of quantifying the
model error is to quantify the uncertainty of the measurements against which the model predictions are to be compared. This is the subject of the next section.


\section{Experimental Uncertainty}

The documentation of the experiments described in the previous chapter have various levels of uncertainty analysis associated with the reported measurements. Quite a
few of the test reports include none whatsoever.
However, in order to assess the accuracy of the model whose predictions have been compared to these measurements, there must be some estimate of the
combined effect of the uncertainty in the reported experimental conditions, like the heat release rate of the fire,
and the reported measurements of the quantities of interest, like the hot gas layer (HGL)
temperature or heat flux. Otherwise, the difference between model and measurement would simply have to be attributed as model error and there is no point in
continuing this exercise.

Rather than throwing out several decades worth of fire test data, there are ways that we can estimate the uncertainty of the measurements based on work
that has been done to quantify the accuracy of such devices as heat flux gauges, oxygen-depletion calorimeters, thermocouples and gas sensors.
In a recent fire model validation study conducted by the U.S.~Nuclear Regulatory Commission~\cite{NUREG_1824}, Hamins estimated the combined
uncertainty of the quantities of interest for the large scale fire experiments under consideration. Referring to Fig.~\ref{scatterplot}, there were
two uncertainty estimates needed for each quantity. The first was an estimate, expressed in the form of a 95~\% confidence interval, of the
uncertainty in the measured quantity itself. For example, reported gas and surface temperatures were made with thermocouples of various designs (bare-bead,
shielded, aspirated) with different size beads, metals, and so on. For each, one can estimate the uncertainty in the reported measurement. Next, the
uncertainty of the measurements of the reported conditions was estimated, including the heat release rate, leakage area, ventilation rate, material
properties, and so on. The effect of these uncertainties on the reported measured quantity had to be assessed as well. For example, most of the
experiments used oxygen consumption calorimetry as the means of measuring the heat release rate.
Estimates of the uncertainty in large scale calorimeters is on the order of 15~\%. It has been shown~\cite{SFPE} that the hot gas layer temperature rise due to
a compartment fire is proportional to the HRR raised to the two-thirds power, thus a 15~\% uncertainty in the HRR would lead to a $2/3 \times 15$~\%=10~\%
uncertainty in the model prediction. This uncertainty now needs to be combined with the uncertainty in the thermocouple measurement itself. Let us say that
this is also 10~\%. Because the two forms of uncertainty are uncorrelated, they are combined by quadrature (summing of squares) to yield a combined
uncertainty of 14~\%. An other way to look at this is to recognize that the combined uncertainty is represented as the diagonal of the rectangle formed
from the horizontal and vertical uncertainty bars in Fig.~\ref{scatterplot}.

Hamins performed this exercise for ten quantities of interest in the U.S. NRC validation study. The results are summarized in Table~\ref{Uncertainty}, with
each combined uncertainty reported in the form of a 95~\% confidence interval ({\em i.e.} $2 \, \tilde{\sigma}_E$). The tilde above the $\sigma$ denotes a
{\em relative uncertainty}, which is a convenient way to report it because we are assuming that the uncertainty in the reported value is proportional to
its magnitude. This assumption is made throughout the analysis for both measurement uncertainty and model error. The assumption is based on a
qualitative assessment of dozens of scatter plots similar to that shown in Fig.~\ref{scatterplot} that show the scattered points to form an expanding ``wedge''
about the diagonal line, or some other off-diagonal line due to an assumed bias in the model predictions. This assessment is a critical component of the
analysis described in the next section.

\section{Calculating Model Error}

We are now ready to describe a method of extracting an estimate of the model error from a set of measured and predicted values, with only an estimate of
the combined experimental uncertainty as a way to characterize the accuracy of the measurements.
The set of model predictions and the corresponding set of experimental measurements are denoted
$M_i$ and $E_i$, respectively, where $i$ ranges from 1 to $n$. Without loss of generality, assume that the
ambient value of these quantities is zero. With this information, {\em and only this information}, we seek to quantify the model error.

In addition to assuming that the experimental uncertainty and the model error can be expressed in relative terms, we also assume that
the experimental and model data is normally distributed. Given the complexity of both the model and the experiment, it is hard to justify
any particular distribution. In fact, the very reason why we have developed this method of quantifying model error based on validation
experiments is because the model algorithm itself is too complicated to work with directly as a means of estimating the error.

With these assumptions in mind, we proceed with the statistical analysis of the data.
First, assume that $E|\theta \sim N(\theta,\sigma_E^2)$, meaning that the probability distribution of $E$
is conditional on a particular value of $\theta$. This is the usual way of defining a likelihood function. The parameter $\theta$ is the ``true'' value of the quantity under
consideration. Essentially, we are assuming that the experimental measurement has no bias and its standard deviation, $\sigma_E$, has been
determined following the procedure described in the
previous section. Table~\ref{Uncertainty} lists the relative experimental uncertainty, $\tilde{\sigma}_E=\sigma_E/\theta$, for the various quantities of interest.
In the analysis to follow, it is convenient to work with $\ln(E)$ because the standard deviation of $\ln(E)$ is approximately $\tilde{\sigma}_E$.
We can use the usual delta method~\cite{delta_method} to obtain the approximate distribution $\ln(E)|\theta \sim N(\ln(\theta),\tilde{\sigma}_E^2)$.
Using a Bayesian argument with a non-informative prior on $\ln(\theta)$, we obtain the posterior distribution as $\ln(\theta) \sim N(\ln(E),\tilde{\sigma}_E^2)$ .

Next, assume that $M|\theta \sim N(\delta \, \theta,\sigma_M^2)$ , where $\delta$ is a systematic multiplicative bias and $\sigma_M$ is the standard deviation.
Again using the log transformation we obtain $\ln(M)|\theta \sim N(\ln(\delta)+\ln(\theta),\tilde{\sigma}_M^2/\delta^2)$
where $\tilde{\sigma}_M=\sigma_M/\theta$. Now since $\ln(\theta)$ is random, and we have its posterior distribution from above we can obtain the marginal density
(that is for any $\theta$) of $\ln(M) \sim N(\ln(\delta)+\ln(E),(\tilde{\sigma}_M/\delta)^2+\tilde{\sigma}_E^2)$.

What we need now is a way to estimate $\delta$, the bias factor, and $\tilde{\sigma}_M$, the relative uncertainty, of the model predictions. First, define:
\be \bar{M} = \frac{1}{n} \, \sum_{i=1}^n \, \ln(M_i)  \quad ; \quad \bar{E} = \frac{1}{n} \, \sum_{i=1}^n \, \ln(E_i) \ee
The usual least squares estimate of $\ln(\delta)$ is $\bar{M}-\bar{E}$, and, thus, the estimate of $\delta$ is
\be \hat{\delta} = \exp(\bar{M}-\bar{E}) \ee
Now define
\be \hat{M}_i = \bar{M}-\bar{E} + \ln(E_i) \ee
The least squares estimate of the standard deviation of $\ln(M_i)$ is
\be u(M) = \sqrt{(\tilde{\sigma}_M/\delta)^2+\tilde{\sigma}_E^2} \approx \sqrt{ \frac{1}{n-1} \sum_{i=1}^n \, \left[ \ln(M_i)-\hat{M}_i \right]^2 } \ee
Note that $u(M)$ is the {\em total relative uncertainty} of $M$.
The model-intrinsic component, $\tilde{\sigma}_M$, can be estimated from
\be \tilde{\sigma}_M = \hat{\delta} \, \sqrt{u(M)^2-\tilde{\sigma}_E^2} \label{model_error} \ee
In essence, this procedure gives us a way to estimate the ``true'' value, $\theta$, using only a predicted value, $M$, and the bias and relative uncertainty
for that particular quantity that have been obtained using past validation experiments. The ``truth'' is a random variable with the following distribution:
\be \theta \sim N \left( M/\delta,(M \, \tilde{\sigma}_M/\delta)^2 \right) \label{truth} \ee
Below, we describe how one might make use of this formula in practice. First, however, we need to verify the accuracy of the procedure just described.

\section{Verifying the Procedure}

The statistical analysis described in the previous section is difficult to understand without a fairly good background in Bayesian analysis.
However, the calculation itself is no more difficult than determining means and standard deviations of a few columns of numbers and it can be easily
done with a simple spreadsheet program.
In fact, to verify this procedure, we generate 1000 random numbers between 0 and 1000. We say that these numbers represent the ``true'' temperatures, $\theta_i$,
from 1000 fire
experiments. Of course, we would never know the true temperatures -- this is only done for verification purposes. Next, for each $\theta_i$, we randomly choose an
experimental measurement, $E_i$, from a normal distribution whose mean is $\theta_i$ and whose relative uncertainty, $\tilde{\sigma}_E=0.07$, obtained from Table~\ref{Uncertainty},
``HGL Temperature.'' Finally, for each $\theta_i$ we randomly choose a model prediction, $M_i$, from a normal distribution whose mean is $1.2 \, \theta_i$
and whose relative uncertainty is 0.3~. In other words, we create a hypothetical set of measurements and predictions with known distributions.
What we have created are 1000 pairs of $(E_i,M_i)$ based on a given experimental uncertainty, $\tilde{\sigma}_E$, and an assumed set of ``true'' values.
The statistical procedure outlined above ought to provide estimates of the values of the bias factor, $\delta$, and the model error, $\tilde{\sigma}_M=$, whose
values we used in creating the data in the first place. These parameters, in turn, would then allow us to estimate the ``true'' values if this were a real
application of the model.

\section{Limitations}

The above verification exercise is valuable in assuring that the procedure works as designed, but it also points out a few issues that need to be addressed. First, any
statistical procedure is based on the law of averages, or, in other words, more data is better than less. It is usually not possible to conduct a large number of
fire experiments
to assess the accuracy of the model in predicting each quantity of interest. Sometimes we only have a few data points with which to estimate the model error. Worse yet,
we may not have the necessary information about the experimental procedure to estimate the uncertainty of the reported measurements. In such cases, it may be better
to simply present the comparison of model prediction and experimental measurement as a series of plots like Fig.~\ref{temp_history}, or in the form of a scatter plot
(Fig.~\ref{scatterplot}) without any uncertainty or error bars. The value of the entire validation process as outlined above is that it is possible at any step
along the way to simply stop and accept the raw output of the study as the basis for making an assessment of the model. The uncertainty analysis is useful only to
the extent that sufficient experimental data with quantified uncertainty estimates is available. It does more harm than good to attempt to quantify the model error
with insufficient means to do so.

Another concern with the above procedure is that an over-estimate of the experimental uncertainty will naturally result in an under-estimate of the model error. Keep
in mind that the model can never be declared more accurate than the experimental measurements against which it is compared. This rule is demonstrated
mathematically by Eq.~(\ref{model_error}) where it is observed that an over-estimate of the experimental uncertainty, $\tilde{\sigma}_E$, can result in
the square root of a negative number, an imaginary number.

\section{Making Use of the Model Error}

The previous sections describes a method of quantifying the model error by comparing its predictions with experimental measurements. But how does one make use of this
information? This is best answered with an example. Suppose the model is being used to estimate the likelihood that electrical control cables could be damaged due to
a fire in a particular compartment. Damage is assumed to occur when the surface temperature of any cable reaches 400~$^\circ$C. It is also assumed that the fire is
ignited within an electrical cabinet and the heat release rate of the fire is a specified function of time, and that all other input
parameters for the model are known and provided. Finally, it is assumed, for the time being, that there is no uncertainty
associated with any of these assumptions. What is the likelihood that the cables would be damaged if that fire were to occur? The calculation is performed, and the
model predicts that the maximum surface temperature of the cables is 350~$^\circ$C. Does this mean that there is no chance of damage, assuming that the input parameters
and assumptions are not in question at the moment? The answer is no, because we know that the model itself is subject to error. So what is the chance that the
cables could actually reach temperatures greater than 400~$^\circ$C?

Before we can answer this question, we need to consider past experiments for which model predictions have been compared to measured surface temperatures of objects
with similar thermal characteristics as the cables in question. How ``similar'' the experiment is to the hypothetical scenario under study can be quantified by way of
various parameters, like the thermal inertia of the object, the size of the fire, the size of the compartment, and so on. Next, the results of the validation study can be
analyzed following the procedure spelled out above, which provides us with a bias factor, $\delta$, and relative uncertainty, $\tilde{\sigma}_M$, for the model
predictions of this particular quantity. Let us say, for the sake of argument, that the bias factor is 1.1; that is, on average, the model has been shown to over-predict
surface temperatures by 10~\%. Let us also say that the relative uncertainty has been calculated and it is 0.15~.
Now, consider the graph shown in Fig.~\ref{sample_plot}. The vertical lines indicate the temperature at which damage is assumed to occur (400~$^\circ$C),
and the temperature predicted by the
model (350~$^\circ$C). The bell curve is a normal distribution obtained from Eq.~(\ref{truth}) above. Its mean is 20+(350-20)/1.1 and its standard deviation
is 0.15(350-20)/1.1 . Notice that the statistical analysis
above assumes that the measured and predicted quantity, in this case surface temperature, is reported as a change above or below its ambient value, which is
20~$^\circ$C in this case.

The obvious question to ask at this point is what do we do if we cannot assume that the specified fire, material properties, and other input parameters are
known exactly? How does that affect our estimate of the likelihood of cable damage? The procedure above has only provided a way of expressing the model
error. What about the so-called ``user effects''? What if the specified fire in the electrical cabinet is actually chosen from a distribution of heat release rates?
What if the material properties of the cables are not known exactly? The answer is probably the subject of several other papers, but assuming that the model error
and input parameter uncertainty are uncorrelated, they could probably be combined following the procedure used to determine the combined experimental uncertainty. Of
course, the uncertainty associated with the input parameters would need to be quantified and propagated through the model. The end result would be a widening of
the distribution shown in Fig.~\ref{sample_plot} and an increase in the likelihood of cable damage, assuming that the parameters used in the ``base case'' were
all taken as the mean values of their respective distributions. In fact, depending on the scenario, the uncertainty associated with the input parameters far outweighs
the model error.


\section{Conclusion}

This chapter outlines a procedure to estimate model error by way of comparisons of model predictions with experimental measurements whose uncertainty has been
quantified. For clarity of presentation, issues associated with the selection of experiments, metrics of comparison, and presentation of results, have not been
discussed in detail because these decisions are application-specific and best left to the end user or AHJ. The procedure is not a dramatic departure from current
methods of model validation.
