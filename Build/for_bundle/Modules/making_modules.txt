Suppose you have a script that sets environment variables.
If you want to make a module from this script perform the
following steps

1.  env | sort > file1
2.  run the script that sets environtment variables
3.  env | sort > file2
4.  ./env2mod -f file1 file2 
5.  clean up module file named modulefile created by env2mod

The program env2mod is located in the smv repo and may be built
using scripts at smv/Build/env2mod.
