 
<h2>Installing Open MPI</h2>
<ul>
<li> The OpenMPI compressed archive, openmpi_VERSION_PLATFORM_64.tar.gz, is located
in the same directory containing fds where PLATFORM is either linux or osx
and VERSION is the openmpi version string.
The directory containing fds may be found by typing <pre>which fds</pre> on a command line.
To install OpenMPI:

<ol>
<li>  copy openmpi_VERSION_PLATFORM_64.tar.gz to the desired OpenMPI location
<li>  cd to that directory
<li>  type: tar xvf openmpi_VERSION_PLATFORM_64.tar.gz
<li>  edit the following line in the .bashrc file (or .bash_profile on the Mac) so that the argument
contains the path pointing to the OpenMPI location.
<pre>
    source ~/.bashrc_fds path_to_openmpi_location
</pre>
</ol>

<p><li>To install in the fds bin directory, type: 
<pre>
cd path_to_fds_bin_directory
tar xvf openmpi_VERSION_PLATFORM_64.tar.gz
</pre>
and add path_to_bin_directory to the <tt>source ~/.bashrc_fds</tt> line in .bashrc (or .bash_profile on the Mac)

</ul>

<h2>Using a Different Intel Fortran Version</h2>
<ul>

<li><p>fds in this installation was built using Intel Fortran version 17.
If you wish to build and run fds using a different Intel Fortran version
pass a second argument to <tt>.bashrc_fds</tt> giving the location of the Intel shared libraries
for that version.  In general, the following should be in your .bashrc (Linux) or .bash_profile (Mac)
startup  file

<p><tt>source ~/.bashrc_fds path_to_openmpi_library path_to_Intel_shared libraries</tt>

<p>The following line

<p><tt>source ~/.bashrc_fdss /shared/openmpi_64 /opt/intel17/compilers_and_libraries/linux/lib/intel64

<p>would setup your system to build and run fds using an OpenMPI library located
at <tt>/shared/openmpi_64</tt> and version 17 of the Intel Fortran compiler.
</ul>
