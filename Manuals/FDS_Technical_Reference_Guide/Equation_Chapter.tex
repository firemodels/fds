\chapter{Overview of the FDS Model}

\label{basisformodel}

This chapter presents the governing equations of FDS and an outline of the general solution procedure. Details are included in subsequent chapters. The purpose of this chapter is to highlight aspects of the solution methodology that make it practical for thermally-driven flow simulations, in particular fire. Some of the major features of the model, in its default operation, are:
\begin{itemize}
\item Low Mach, large-eddy simulation (LES)
\item Explicit, second-order, energy conserving numerics
\item Structured, uniform, staggered grid
\item Simple immersed boundary method for treatment of flow obstructions
\item Generalized ``lumped species'' method (simplified reaction progress variable approach)
\item Smagorinsky subgrid closure (constant or dynamic coefficient)
\item Constant turbulent Schmidt and Prandtl numbers
\item Eddy dissipation model (fast chemistry) for single-step reaction between fuel and oxidizer
\item Gray gas radiation with finite volume solution to the radiation transport equation
\end{itemize}

The model, however, is not limited to these simple algorithms. For example, the user may specify multiple reactions, finite-rate chemistry, a wide-band radiation model, and a variety of other special features. The more detailed physics incur increased computational cost and it is incumbent on the user to justify the added expense in terms of improved accuracy.  The default model options have been selected based on results from a wide variety of full-scale validation experiments \cite{FDS_Validation_Guide}.

The algorithm outlined below has evolved over roughly three decades. Initially, it was designed to study buoyant plumes in the
Boussinesq limit; that is, the fluid was assumed incompressible but included a source term for buoyancy. This approach was based
on a long tradition in fire research of modeling smoke movement using dyed salt water introduced into a tank filled with fresh
water. Eventually, this approach proved too limiting, but some of the major features of the algorithm, like the low
Mach number approximation, were retained.

\section{LES Formalism}
\label{filteredfields}

The equations for large-eddy simulation (LES) are derived by applying a low-pass filter, parameterized by a width $\Delta$, to the transport equations for mass, momentum and energy.  For our purposes, it is sufficient to think of the filtered fields in the LES equations as cell means.  For example, in 1D the filtered density for a cell of width $\Delta$ is
\begin{equation}
\label{eqn_filtered_density}
\bar{\rho}(x,t) = \frac{1}{\Delta}\int_{x-\Delta/2}^{x+\Delta/2} \rho(r,t) \,\mbox{d}r \mbox{.}
\end{equation}

In FDS, the filter width $\Delta$ is equivalent to the local cell size $\delta x$ and is a key parameter in the submodels for the turbulent viscosity and the reaction time scale discussed later.  The practice of taking $\Delta = \delta x$ is called implicit filtering.  In what follows, the filter formalism is relaxed (the overline notation is suppressed for clarity) since no explicit filtering operations are performed in the algorithm (except within the dynamic procedure).

\section{Numerical Grid}
\label{govequations}

FDS is designed to be used by practicing engineers for a variety of fire protection and other thermal flow applications.
Therefore, it must be relatively fast and robust, and it must be easy to describe the scenario. This means that the user
should only have to specify a small number of numerical parameters, focusing instead on the physical description of the
problem. Because the
computational domain usually encompasses a volume within a building, or the entire building itself, the
most obvious and simplest numerical grid is rectilinear.
In fact, because FDS is a large eddy simulation (LES) model, uniform meshing is
preferred, and the only numerical parameters chosen by the end user are the three dimensions of the grid. Once established, it
is relatively simple to define rectangular obstructions that define the geometry to the level of resolution determined by the
grid. These obstructions ``snap'' to the underlying grid, a very elementary form of an immersed boundary method (IBM).

The governing equations are approximated using second-order accurate finite differences on a collection of uniformly spaced three-dimensional grids. Multiple meshes can be processed in parallel using Message Passing Interface (MPI) libraries. Scalar quantities are assigned to the center of each grid cell; vector components are assigned at the appropriate cell faces. This is what is commonly referred to as a staggered grid \cite{Harlow:1}.  Its main purpose is to avoid numerical dispersion error (checker-boarding) in pressure-velocity coupling by naturally representing the pressure cell velocity divergence, a very important thermodynamic quantity in the model.

\section{Mass and Species Transport}
\label{sec_lumped_species}

The most basic description of the chemistry of fire is a reaction of a hydrocarbon fuel with oxygen that produces carbon dioxide and water vapor. Because fire is a relatively
inefficient combustion process involving multiple fuel gases that contain more than just carbon and hydrogen atoms, the number of gas species to keep track of in the simulation
is almost limitless. However, to make the simulations tractable, we limit the number of fuels to one, usually, and the number of reactions to just one or two. We also leave open
the possibility that the reaction may not proceed for lack of sufficient oxygen in the incoming air stream, as when a fire in a closed compartment extinguishes itself. Even
with this simplified approach to the chemistry, we still need to track at least six gas species (Fuel, O$_2$, CO$_2$, H$_2$O, CO, N$_2$) plus soot particulate. If we assume a single-step
reaction, we do not need
to solve explicitly seven transport equations. In fact, we only need to solve two -- one for the fuel and one for the products. The air is everything that is neither fuel nor
products. Whereas the fuel is a single gas species, the air and products are what are often referred to as ``lumped species''.
A lumped species represents a mixture of gas species that are transported together ({\em i.e.} the lumped species has a single set of transport properties), and from the point of
view of the numerical model it can be treated as a single species. In fact, the mass transport equations make no distinction between a single or lumped species. For example, air is a
lumped species that consists of nitrogen, oxygen, and trace amounts of water vapor and carbon dioxide.
We use the symbols $Z_A$, $Z_F$, and $Z_P$ to denote the mass fractions of air, fuel and products ($Z_A=1 - Z_F - Z_P$).  The lumped species mass fractions are linearly related
to the primitive species mass fractions, $Y_\alpha$; thus, conversion from one to the other is a simple matter of performing a matrix multiplication.  For example, the complete
combustion of methane:
\be \mathrm{CH_4 + 2 \, \left( O_2 + 3.76 \, N_2 \right)  \rightarrow CO_2 +2 \, H_2O + 7.52 \, N_2} \ee
is expressed as
\be \hbox{Fuel} + 2 \, \hbox{Air} \rightarrow \hbox{Products} \ee
and the primitive species can be recovered from the lumped species via
\be \left[ \begin{array} {c c c}
0.77 & 0.00 & 0.73 \\
0.23 & 0.00 & 0.00 \\
0.00 & 1.00 & 0.00 \\
0.00 & 0.00 & 0.15 \\
0.00 & 0.00 & 0.12  \end{array}
\right]
\left[ \begin{array} {c} Z_A \\ Z_F \\ Z_P \end{array} \right] =
\left[ \begin{array} {c} Y_\NTWO \\ Y_\OTWO \\ Y_{\scriptscriptstyle \mathrm{CH_4}} \\ Y_\COTWO \\ Y_{\scriptscriptstyle \mathrm{H_2O}} \end{array} \right]
 \ee

The lumped species approach does not change the basic mass transport equations. The equation for total mass is written:
\be \dod{\rho}{t} + \nabla\!\cdot (\rho \bu)  =  \dm_b'''  \label{mass} \ee
Note that the source term on the right hand side represents the addition of mass from evaporating droplets or other subgrid-scale
particles that represent sprinkler and fuel sprays, vegetation, and any other type of small, unresolvable object. These
objects are assumed to occupy no volume; thus are seen by the governing equations as point sources of mass, momentum and energy. It is important to
note, however, that the evaporated mass species must be one for which an explicit transport equation is solved. For example, water vapor is a product of
combustion, but it is also formed by evaporating sprinkler droplets. In cases such as these, there needs to be an explicit transport equation for water
vapor to distinguish between that which is formed by combustion and that which is evaporated from the droplets.

The transport equation for each of the lumped species minus one (usually air) has the same form as the transport equation for a single species:
\be \dod{ }{t}(\rho Z_\alpha) + \nabla\!\cdot (\rho Z_\alpha \bu) = \nabla\!\cdot (\rho D_\alpha \nabla Z_\alpha) + \dm_\alpha''' + \dm_{b,\alpha}''' \label{species} \ee
Here $\dm_b'''=\sum_\alpha \dm_{b,\alpha}'''$ is the production rate of species by evaporating droplets or particles.
Summing these equations over all species yields the original mass conservation equation because
$\sum Z_\alpha=1$ and $\sum \dm_\alpha''' = 0$ and $\sum \dm_{b,\alpha}'''=\dm_b'''$, by definition, and because it is assumed
that $\sum \rho D_\alpha \nabla Z_\alpha = 0$. This last assertion is not true, in general.
However, transport equations are solved for total
mass and all but one of the species, implying that the diffusion coefficient of the implicit species is
chosen so that the sum of all the diffusive fluxes is zero.

\section{Low Mach Number Approximation}

Rehm and Baum~\cite{Rehm:1} observed that for low speed applications like fire, the spatially and temporally resolved pressure, $p$, can be decomposed into a ``background'' pressure, $\bp(z,t)$, plus a perturbation, $\tp(x,y,z,t)$, with only the background pressure retained in the equation of state:
\be \bp = \rho T {\cal R} \sum_\alpha  \frac{Z_\alpha}{W_\alpha} \equiv \frac{\rho \R T}{\bW}  \label{basicstate1} \ee
Note that $z$ is the spatial coordinate in the direction of gravity; thus, the stratification of the atmosphere is included in the background pressure. The perturbation, $\tp$, drives the fluid motion. This approximation has a number of consequences. First, building compartments connected via a heating, ventilation, and air conditioning system can each maintain individual background pressures. The air flows between compartments can be
described in terms of the differences in the background pressures, eliminating the need to solve detailed flow equations within the ventilation ducts.

The second consequence of the low Mach number approximation is that it eliminates the need to solve the energy transport
equation explicitly.
The energy conservation equation is written in terms of the {\em sensible enthalpy}, $h_s$:
\be \dod{ }{t}(\rho h_s) + \nabla\!\cdot (\rho h_s \bu) = \frac{\mbox{D}p}{\mbox{D}t}  + \dq''' - \dq_b'''
        - \nabla\!\cdot \dbq'' \label{energy} \ee
Note that the material derivative of the thermodynamic pressure is simplified because of the low Mach number approximation:
\be
   \frac{\mbox{D}p}{\mbox{D}t} \equiv \frac{\partial p}{\partial t} + \bu \cdot \nabla p \approx
   \frac{\partial \bp}{\partial t} + w \dod{\bp}{z}
\ee
The term
$\dq'''$ is the heat release rate per unit volume from a chemical reaction.
The term $\dq_b'''$ is the energy transferred to subgrid-scale droplets and particles.
The term $\dbq''$ represents the conductive and radiative heat fluxes:
\be \dbq'' = -k \nabla T - \sum_\alpha h_{s,\alpha} \rho D_\alpha \nabla Z_\alpha + \dbq_r'' \ee
where $k$ is the thermal conductivity and $D_\alpha$ is the diffusivity of species $\alpha$.

As mentioned above, we do not actually solve Eq.~(\ref{energy}). Instead, we form an expression for the divergence of
the velocity starting with the mass conservation equation (\ref{mass}), and then take the material
derivative of the equation of state (\ref{basicstate1}):
\be
\label{eqn_simplediv1}
\Div\mathbf{u} = \frac{1}{\rho} \left( \dot{m}_b^{\tripleprime} -  \frac{\mbox{D} \rho}{\mbox{D} t} \right) =
\frac{1}{\rho} \,\dot{m}_b^{\tripleprime} -  \frac{1}{\bp} \frac{\mbox{D}\bp}{\mbox{D} t} +
\overline{W} \frac{\mbox{D}}{\mbox{D} t}\left(\frac{1}{\overline{W}}\right) +
\frac{1}{T} \frac{\mbox{D} T}{\mbox{D} t}
\ee
Expanding the material derivatives on the right hand side of this equation produces a fairly complicated expression for
the divergence that includes the source and diffusion terms from the mass, species and energy conservation equations.
However, its importance to the overall algorithm is that it can be computed using only the
thermodynamic variables $\rho$, $Z_\alpha$, and $\bp$. As will be shown below, the way to advance the flow velocity in time
is to first estimate the thermodynamic variables at the next time step, compute the divergence, and then solve an equation
for the pressure that will guarantee that the divergence of the updated velocity is identical to that computed solely from
the thermodynamic variables.



\section{Momentum Transport}

Noting the vector identity $(\bu \cdot \nabla) \bu = \nabla|\bu|^2/2 - \bu\times\bo $ and defining the stagnation energy per unit mass ${\cal H} \equiv |\bu|^2/2 + \tp/\rho$, the momentum equation can be written
\be \dod{\bu}{t} - \bu\times\bo + \nabla {\cal H} - \tp \, \nabla \left( \frac{1}{\rho}\right) = \frac{1}{\rho} \Big[ (\rho-\rho_0) \bg
+ \bof_b + \nabla\!\cdot \btau \Big]  \label{momeq} \ee
The term, $\bof_b$, represents the drag force exerted by the subgrid-scale particles and droplets. The viscous stress, $\btau$, is closed via gradient diffusion with the turbulent viscosity obtained from the Smagorinsky model (constant or dynamic coefficient) \cite{Germano:1991,Moin:1991,Smagorinsky:1}.

It is convenient to write this equation in the form:
\be \dod{\bu}{t} + \bF + \nabla \cH = 0 \label{simple_momentum_equation} \ee
so that a Poisson equation for the pressure can be derived by taking its divergence:
\be \nabla^2 {\cal H} = -\dod{ }{t} (\nabla\!\cdot \bu) - \nabla\!\cdot \bF    \label{simplephi2} \ee
Note the appearance of the time derivative of the divergence. This is an important feature of the time marching scheme. Note also that the right hand side of the Poisson equation retains a term that includes the perturbation pressure, $\tp \, \nabla (1/\rho)$. This term accounts for the baroclinic torque. It is included on the right hand side of the Poisson equation by using its value from the previous time step. This approximation allows us to solve a separable form of the Poisson equation, for which there are fast, direct solvers that are optimized for uniform grids~\cite{Sweet:1}.

\section{Combustion and Radiation}

FDS is described as a ``fire model'' because it incorporates source terms and boundary conditions that describe the
turbulent combustion of gaseous fuel and oxygen, the transport of thermal radiation through hot, soot-laden gases, the
thermal decomposition of real materials, the activation of sprinklers and smoke detectors, the transport of water and liquid fuel
droplets, and a variety of other features that describe fires inside and outside of buildings.

Combustion and radiation are introduced into the governing equations via the source terms, $\dq'''$ and $\nabla \cdot \bq_r''$,
in the energy transport equation. Since the energy equation is not solved explicitly, these terms find their way into the
expression for the divergence.

\subsection{Combustion}

For most applications, FDS uses a combustion model based on the mixing-limited, infinitely fast reaction of lumped species.
Lumped species are reacting scalar quantities that represent a mixture of species such as air which is a mixture of
nitrogen, oxygen, water vapor, and carbon dioxide.  The reaction of fuel and oxygen is not necessarily instantaneous and
complete, and there are
several optional schemes that are designed to predict the extent of combustion in under-ventilated spaces.

For an infinitely-fast reaction, reactant species in a given grid cell are converted to product species at a rate determined by a
characteristic mixing time. If any grid cell contains all the reactants of the the chemical reaction and the mass fractions of reactants and products meet certain criteria, the heat release rate per unit volume is given by the eddy dissipation model~\cite{Poinsot:TNC}
\be
   \dq''' \equiv -\dm_f''' \, \Delta H = -\rho \min \left( Y_\F , \frac{Y_\OTWO}{s}, \beta \frac{Y_{\hbox{\tiny P}}}{1+s} \right) \;
   \left( 1 - e^{-\dt/\tau_{mix}} \right)  \; \Delta H \quad ; \quad
   s=\frac{W_\F}{\nu_{\OTWO} W_{\OTWO} }  \label{EDC1}
\ee  %Y rather than Z is correct in this equation
Here, $Y_\F$, $Y_\OTWO$, and $Y_{\hbox{\tiny P}}$ are the mass fractions of fuel, oxygen and products within a grid cell; $\beta$ is an empirical parameter.  The mixing time $\tau_{mix}$ is given by
\begin{equation}
\label{eqn_tau_mix}
\tau_{mix} = \max(\tau_{chem},\min(\tau_d,\tau_u,\tau_g,\tau_{flame}))
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}
\tau_{d}= \frac{\mbox{Sc}_t\rho\Delta^2}{\mu} \,\mbox{;}\quad
\tau_{u}= \frac{\Delta}{\sqrt{2k_{sgs}}} \,\mbox{;}\quad
\tau_{g}= \sqrt{ 2\Delta/g }
\end{equation}
Note that $k_{sgs}$ is the subgrid kinetic energy per unit mass which is closed by integrating a model Kolmogorov spectrum . The acceleration time scale $\tau_{g}$ is the time required to travel a distance $\Delta$ starting from rest under a constant acceleration, $g=9.81$ m/s$^2$.  The chemistry time scale $\tau_{chem}$ (usually very small) and the flame time scale $\tau_{flame}$ (usually very large) are physical limits on the mixing time which may be adjusted if necessary by the user.


\subsection{Radiation}


The net contribution from thermal radiation in the energy equation is defined by:
\be
   -\nabla\!\cdot \dbq_r''(\bx) =
    \kappa(\bx) \, \left[ U(\bx) - 4 \pi \, I_b(\bx) \right]  \quad ; \quad
    U(\bx) = \int_{4\pi} \, I(\bx,\bs') \, d\bs'
\ee
where $\kappa(\bx)$ is the absorption coefficient,
$I_b(\bx)$ is the source term, and $I(\bx,\bs)$ is the solution of the radiation transport equation (RTE) for
a non-scattering gray gas:
\be   \bs \cdot \nabla I(\bx,\bs) = \kappa(\bx) \; \left[ I_{b}(\bx) - I(\bx,\bs) \right]
\label{bandRTE1} \ee
In practical simulations, the spectral dependence of $I$, $I_b$, and $\kappa$ cannot be resolved
accurately, nor do we have reliable data for non-ideal fuels typical of real fires.
While FDS does have an option to divide the radiation spectrum into
a relatively small number of bands and solve a separate RTE for
each band, it is usually not necessary because in real fires, soot is the dominant source and sink of
thermal radiation and is not particulary sensitive to wavelength.
The mean absorption coefficient, $\kappa$, is a function of species composition and temperature.
Its values are obtained by table look-up using a narrow-band model, RadCal~\cite{RadCal}.

The source term, $I_b$, requires special treatment because of the limited resolution of the underlying numerical
grid in the vicinity of flames. In large scale fire simulations, grid cells are typically on the order of
tens of centimeters. Relatively thin flame sheets cannot be resolved, in which case the resolved temperature field
will not reflect the true temperatures one would expect to find in the reaction zone. Consequently, the
source term is approximated in grid cells where fuel and oxygen react.
Elsewhere, there is greater confidence in the resolved temperature field,
and the source term can be computed directly.
\be \kappa \; I_b = \left\{ \begin{array}{cl}
    \kappa \, \sigma \, T^4/\pi                                           & \hbox{Outside flame zone} \\ [0.15in]
    \max(\chi_r \, \dot{q}'''/4 \pi \; , \; \kappa \, \sigma \, T^4/\pi)  & \hbox{Inside flame zone}
    \end{array} \right.  \label{radapprox1} \ee
Here, $\chi_r$ is an empirical estimate of the {\em local} fraction of
that energy emitted as thermal radiation. Typically, a sooty fire radiates approximately one-third of the total
combustion energy.

The radiation equation is solved using a technique similar to a finite
volume method for convective transport, thus the name given to it is
the Finite Volume Method (FVM). Using approximately 100 discrete
angles which are updated over multiple time steps, the finite volume solver requires about 20~\% of the total CPU
time of a calculation, a modest cost given the complexity of radiation
heat transfer.  Water droplets can absorb and scatter thermal
radiation. This is important in cases involving mist sprinklers, but
also plays a role in all sprinkler cases. The absorption and
scattering coefficients are based on Mie theory. The scattering from
the gaseous species and soot is not included in the model.



\section{Solution Procedure}

In given grid cell at the $n$th time step, we have the density, $\rho^n$, lumped species mass fractions, $Z_\alpha^n$, velocity
vector, $\bu^n$, and perturbation pressure term, $\cH^n$.
In addition, for each compartment in the computational domain, we have a background pressure, $\bp^n$. The temperature is
found from the equation of state. These variables are advanced in time using an explicit second-order predictor/corrector scheme.
The basic procedure is as follows:

\paragraph{Predictor}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Estimate $\rho$, $Z_\alpha$, and $\bp$ at the next time step with an explicit Euler step. For
example, the density is estimated by
\be \frac{\rho^*-\rho^n}{\dt} + \nabla\!\cdot \rho^n \bu^n = 0 \ee
The asterisk denotes a first order accurate estimate at the next time step.  Note that the source term is time-split, as discussed below.

\item \label{step_pred_div} Compute the divergence, $(\nabla\!\cdot \bu)^*$, from Eq.~(\ref{eqn_simplediv1}) using the estimated thermodynamic quantities. Note that we use the parentheses to emphasize that an estimate of the velocity field, $\bu^*$, at the next time step has not been computed yet, only its divergence.

\item Solve the Poisson equation for the pressure term:
\be \nabla^2 \cH^n = - \frac{ (\nabla\!\cdot \bu)^* - \nabla\!\cdot \bu^n }{\dt} - \nabla\!\cdot \bF^n  \ee

\item Estimate the velocity at the next time step.
\be
\frac{\bu^* - \bu^n}{\dt} +  \bF^n + \nabla {\cal H}^n = 0
\ee
Note that this procedure guarantees that the divergence of the estimated velocity field, $\nabla\!\cdot \bu^*$, is identically
equal to the divergence that is derived from the estimated thermodynamic quantities, $(\nabla\!\cdot \bu)^*$, in Step \ref{step_pred_div}.

\item Check that the time step, $\dt$, satisfies the CFL and Von Neumann stability conditions:
\be \dt \; \left( \frac{|u|}{\dx} + \frac{|v|}{\dy} + \frac{|w|}{\dz} \right) < 1 \quad ; \quad
    2 \; \dt \; \frac{\mu}{\rho} \; \left(\frac{1}{\dx^2} + \frac{1}{\dy^2} + \frac{1}{\dz^2} \right) < 1 \ee
If the time step is too large, it is reduced so that it satisfies
both constraints and the procedure returns to the beginning of the time step.
If the time step satisfies the stability criteria, the procedure continues to the corrector step.
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Corrector}

\begin{enumerate}

\item Correct the density at the next time step.
\be
\frac{\rho^{**} - \ha \left(\rho^n + \rho^* \right)}{\dt/2} +  \nabla\!\cdot \rho^* \bu^* = 0
\ee

The lumped species mass fractions and background pressure are corrected in a similar way.

\item \emph{Time splitting for mass source terms}. After the corrector step for the transport scheme, source terms are applied to the scalars.  The source terms are evaluated using the results from the corrected scalar transport scheme:
\be
\frac{(\rho Y_\alpha)_{ijk}^{n+1}-(\rho Y_\alpha)_{ijk}^{**}}{\dt} =  \dm_{\alpha,ijk}'''(\mathbf{Y}^{**},T^{**})
\ee

\item \label{step_cor_div} Compute the divergence, $(\nabla\!\cdot \bu)^{n+1}$, from the corrected thermodynamic quantities.

\item Compute the pressure term using the estimated quantities.
\be
\label{eqn_corrector_poisson2}
\nabla^2{\cal H}^* = - \left[ \frac{ (\nabla\cdot\bu)^{n+1} - \ha \left( \nabla\cdot \bu^* + \nabla\cdot \bu^n \right) }{\dt/2} \right]
   - \nabla\!\cdot \mathbf{F}^*
\ee

\item Correct the velocity at the next time step.
\be
\frac{ \bu^{n+1} - \ha \left( \bu^* + \bu^n \right)}{\dt/2} + \mathbf{F}^* + \nabla {\cal H}^*  = 0
\ee
Note again that the divergence of the corrected velocity field is identically equal to the divergence that was computed in Step \ref{step_cor_div}.


\end{enumerate}
