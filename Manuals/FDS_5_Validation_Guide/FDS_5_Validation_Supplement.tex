\chapter{Preface}


This supplement to the FDS Technical Reference Guide is based in part on the ``Standard Guide for
Evaluating the Predictive Capability of Deterministic Fire Models,'' ASTM~E~1355~\cite{ASTM:E1355}.
ASTM~E~1355 defines {\em model evaluation} as ``the process of quantifying
the accuracy of chosen results from a model when applied for a specific use.''
The model evaluation process consists of two main components: verification and validation.
{\em Verification} is a process to check the correctness of the solution of the
governing equations. Verification does not imply that the governing equations are
appropriate; only that the equations are being solved correctly.
{\em Validation} is a process to determine the appropriateness of the governing equations as a mathematical
model of the physical phenomena of interest. Typically, validation involves comparing
model results with experimental measurement. Differences that cannot be explained in terms of
numerical errors in the model or uncertainty in the measurements
are attributed to the assumptions and simplifications of the physical model.

Evaluation is critical to establishing both the acceptable uses
and limitations of a model. Throughout its development, FDS has undergone various forms of evaluation,
both at NIST and beyond. This Supplement provides a survey of validation work conducted to date to evaluate FDS.
Documentation of FDS Verification is contained in the FDS User's Guide~\cite{FDS_Users_Guide_5}.


\chapter{Acknowledgments}

\label{acksection}

Support for validation experiments and the preparation of the FDS
manuals has been provided by the Office of Nuclear Regulatory Research
of the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission (US NRC). Special thanks to
Mark Salley and Jason Dreisbach for their efforts.

Alex Maranghides oversees the Large Fire Laboratory at NIST where
these tests were conducted, and has helped to design the
experiments for the NIST/NRC and WTC  Test Series.

Anthony Hamins directed the NIST/NRC and WTC experiments, conducted smaller methane burner
measurements, and quantified the experimental uncertainty of these and other
experiments used in this study.

Rick Peacock of NIST assisted in the interpretation of results from
the ``NBS Multi-Room Test Series,'' a set of three room
fire experiments conducted at the National Bureau of Standards (now
NIST) in the mid-1980's.

Thanks to VTT, Finland, for their contribution of experimental data,
referred to in this document as the ``VTT Large Hall Experiments.''

At the University of Maryland, Professor Fred~Mowrer and Phil Friday
were the first to apply FDS to the NRC-sponsored experiments referred
to in this document as the ``FM/SNL Test Series'' (Factory Mutual and
Sandia National Laboratories conducted these experiments). Thanks also to
Steve Nowlen, the test director, for additional information.

At VTT, Finland, Jukka Hietaniemi, Jukka Vaari and Timo Korhonen have
performed validation studies of various sub-models. The VTT Fire
Research group continues to work on model development and
validation of the model for various applications.
