<h2>FDS and Smokeview Overview</h2>
<p><hr size="1">
<p>

FDS is a computer program that solves equations that describe the evolution of fire. It is a Fortran program
that reads input parameters from a text file, computes a numerical solution to the governing equations, and
writes user-specified output data to files. Smokeview is a companion program that reads FDS output files
and produces animations on the computer screen.

<h3>User Support</h3>
The FDS-Smokeview discussion group exists so that users may discuss fire phenomena related to FDS/Smokeview scenarios.
Similar to the discussion group, is the Issue Tracker which was set up to report problems and to request enhancements.
When reporting a problem to the ISsue Tracker, it is important to simplify your case as much as possible and still exhibit the problem.
The Discussion group and Issue tracker are available at
