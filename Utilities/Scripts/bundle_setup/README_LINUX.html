<p>The Linux version of Smokeview links to shared libraries. As a result,
the environmental variable, <tt>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</tt>, needs to be created (or modified
if it already exists). 

<p>If you are using the csh or tcsh command shells, the 32 bit version of Smokeview 
and installed FDS and Smokeview in your home directory
use the following command:

<p><tt>setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH ${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}:~/FDS/FDS5/bin/lib32</tt>

<p>Change 32 to 64 if you are using the 64 bit version of Smokeview.

<p>If instead you are using the bash shell use the following command:

<p><tt>export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:~/FDS/FDS5/bin/lib32</tt>
