\chapter{About the Developers}

\begin{description}

\item[Kevin McGrattan] is a mathematician in the Fire Research Division of NIST. He received a bachelor of science degree from the School of Engineering and Applied Science of Columbia University in 1987 and a doctorate at the Courant Institute of New York University in 1991. He joined the NIST staff in 1992 and has since worked on the development of fire models, most notably the Fire Dynamics Simulator.

\item[Simo Hostikka] is an associate professor of fire safety engineering at Aalto University School of Engineering, since January 2014. Before joining Aalto, he worked as a Principal Scientist and Team Leader at VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland. He received a master of science (technology) degree in 1997 and a doctorate in 2008 from the Department of Engineering Physics and Mathematics of the Helsinki University of Technology.  He is the principal developer of the radiation and solid phase sub-models within FDS.

\item[Randall McDermott] joined the Fire Research Division at NIST in 2008. He received a B.S.~from the University of Tulsa in Chemical Engineering in 1994 and a Ph.D.~from the University of Utah in 2005. His research interests include subgrid-scale models and numerical methods for large-eddy simulation, adaptive mesh refinement, immersed boundary methods, and Lagrangian particle methods.

\item[Jason Floyd] is a Senior Engineer at Hughes Associates, Inc., in Baltimore, Maryland. He received a bachelor of science and a doctorate in the Nuclear Engineering Program of the University of Maryland. After graduating, he was awarded a National Research Council Post-Doctoral Fellowship at the Building and Fire Research Laboratory of NIST. He is a principal developer of the combustion, control logic, and HVAC sub-models within FDS.

\item[Craig Weinschenk] joined the Fire Research Division as a National Research Council Postdoctoral Research Associate in 2011. He received a B.S.~from Rowan University in 2006 in Mechanical Engineering. He received an M.S.~in 2007 and a doctorate in 2011 from The University of Texas at Austin in Mechanical Engineering. His research interests include numerical combustion, fire-structure interaction, and human factors research of fire-fighting tactics.

\item[Kristopher Overholt] joined the Fire Research Division at NIST in 2013. He received a B.S. in Fire Protection Engineering Technology from the University of Houston-Downtown in 2008, an M.S. in Fire Protection Engineering from Worcester Polytechnic Institute in 2010, and a Ph.D. in Civil Engineering from The University of Texas at Austin in 2013. He works on aspects of FDS related to verification and validation, continuous integration testing, and quality metrics. His research interests include inverse fire modeling problems, soot deposition in fires, and the use of fire models in forensic applications.

\item[Glenn Forney] is a computer scientist in the Fire Research Division of NIST.  He received a bachelor of science degree in mathematics from Salisbury State College and a master of science and a doctorate in mathematics from Clemson University.  He joined NIST in 1986 (then the National Bureau of Standards) and has since worked on developing tools that provide a better understanding of fire phenomena, most notably Smokeview, an advanced scientific software tool for visualizing Fire Dynamics Simulation data.

\item[Timo Korhonen] is a Senior Scientist at VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland. He received a master of science (technology) degree in 1992 and a doctorate in 1996 from the Department of Engineering Physics and Mathematics of the Helsinki University of Technology. He is the principal developer of the evacuation sub-model within FDS.


\item[Daniel Haarhoff] is a masters student working at the J\"ulich Supercomputing Centre in Germany. His thesis is on providing and analysing a hybrid parallelisation of FDS. For this he is creating an OpenMP version of FDS 6.0.

\item[Susan Kilian] is a mathematician with numerics and scientific computing expertise. She received her diploma from the University of Heidelberg and received her doctorate from the Technical University of Dortmund in 2002. Since 2007 she has been a research scientist for hhpberlin, a fire safety engineering firm located in Berlin, Germany. Her research interests include high performance computing and the development of efficient parallel solvers for the pressure Poisson equation.

\item[Vivien Lecoustre] is a Research Associate at the University of Maryland. He received a master of science in Aerospace Engineering from ENSMA (France) in 2005 and a doctorate in Mechanical Engineering from the University of Maryland in 2009. His research interests include radiation properties of fuels and numerical turbulent combustion.

\item[Charles Luo] is a Senior Research Scientist at Global Engineering and Materials, Inc., in Princeton, New Jersey. He received a B.S.~in Theoretical and Applied Mechanics from the University of Science and Technology of China in 2002, and a doctorate in Mechanical Engineering from the State University of New York at Buffalo in 2010. His research interests include fire-structure interaction, immersed boundary methods, and fire response of composite and aluminum structures.

\item[Anna Matala] is a Research Scientist at VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland and a Ph.D.~candidate at Aalto University School of Science. She received her M.Sc.~degree in Systems and Operations Research from Helsinki University of Technology in 2008. Her research concentrates on pyrolysis modelling and parameter estimation in fire simulations

\item[William (Ruddy) Mell] is an applied mathematician currently at the U.S. Forest Service in Seattle, Washington. He holds a B.S. degree from the University of Minnesota (1981) and doctorate from the University of Washington (1994). His research interests include the development of large-eddy simulation methods and sub-models applicable to the physics of large fires in buildings, vegetation, and the wildland-urban interface.

\item[Topi Sikanen] is a Research Scientist at VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland and a graduate student at Aalto University School of Science. He received his M.Sc.~degree in Systems and Operations Research from Helsinki University of Technology in 2008. He works on the Lagrangian particle and liquid evaporation models.

\item[Ben Trettel] is a graduate student at The University of Texas at Austin. He received a B.S.~in Mechanical Engineering in 2011 and an M.S.~in Fire Protection Engineering in 2013, both from the University of Maryland.
