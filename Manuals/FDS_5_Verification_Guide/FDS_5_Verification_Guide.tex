\chapter{Preface}

This is Volume 2 of the FDS Technical Reference Guide. Volume 1 describes the mathematical model and
numerical method. Volume 3 documents past and present experimental validation work. Instructions for
using FDS are contained in a separate User's Guide~\cite{FDS_Users_Guide_5}.

The three volumes of the FDS Technical Reference Guide are based in part on the ``Standard Guide for
Evaluating the Predictive Capability of Deterministic Fire Models,'' ASTM~E~1355~\cite{ASTM:E1355}.
ASTM~E~1355 defines {\em model evaluation} as ``the process of quantifying
the accuracy of chosen results from a model when applied for a specific use.''
The model evaluation process consists of two main components: verification and validation.
{\em Verification} is a process to check the correctness of the solution of the
governing equations. Verification does not imply that the governing equations are
appropriate; only that the equations are being solved correctly.
{\em Validation} is a process to determine the appropriateness of the governing equations as a mathematical
model of the physical phenomena of interest. Typically, validation involves comparing
model results with experimental measurement. Differences that cannot be explained in terms of
numerical errors in the model or uncertainty in the measurements
are attributed to the assumptions and simplifications of the physical model.

Evaluation is critical to establishing both the acceptable uses
and limitations of a model. Throughout its development, FDS has undergone various forms of evaluation,
both at NIST and beyond. This volume provides a survey of verification work conducted to date to evaluate FDS.

\chapter{What is Verification?}

The terms {\em verification} and {\em validation} are often used interchangeably to mean the process of checking the
accuracy of a numerical model. For many, this entails comparing model predictions with experimental measurements. However,
there is now a fairly broad-based consensus that comparing model and experiment is largely what is considered {\em validation}. So what is
{\em verification}? ASTM~E~1355~\cite{ASTM:E1355}, ``Standard Guide for
Evaluating the Predictive Capability of Deterministic Fire Models,'' defines verification as
\begin{quote}
The process of determining that the implementation of a calculation method accurately
represents the developer's conceptual description of the calculation method and the solution to the calculation method.
\end{quote}
and it defines validation as
\begin{quote}
The process of determining the degree to which a calculation method is an accurate representation of the real world
from the perspective of the intended uses of the calculation method.
\end{quote}
Simply put, verification is a check of the math; validation is a check of the physics. If the model predictions closely match
the results of experiments, using whatever metric is appropriate, it is assumed by most that the model suitably describes, via
its mathematical equations, what is happening. It is also assumed that the solution of these equations must be correct. So why do
we need to perform model verification? Why not just skip to validation and be done with it? The reason is that rarely do model and
measurement agree so well in all applications that anyone would just accept its results unquestionably. Because there is
inevitably differences between model and experiment, we need to know if these differences are due to limitations or errors in
the numerical solution, or the physical sub-models, or both.

Whereas model validation consists mainly of comparing predictions with measurements, as documented for FDS in Volume 3 of the
Technical Reference Guide, model verification consists of a much broader range of activities, from checking the computer program
itself to comparing calculations to analytical (exact) solutions to considering the sensitivity of the dozens of numerical
parameters. The next chapter discusses these various activities, and the rest of the Guide is devoted mainly to comparisons of
various sub-model calculations with analytical solutions.








\chapter{Survey of Past Verification Work}

This chapter documents work of the past few decades at NIST, VTT and elsewhere to verify the algorithms within FDS.




\section{Analytical Tests}

\label{Analytical Tests}

Most complex combustion processes, including fire, are turbulent and time-dependent. There are no closed-form mathematical solutions for the
fully-turbulent, time-dependent Navier-Stokes equations. CFD provides an approximate solution for the non-linear partial differential equations by
replacing them with discretized algebraic equations that can be solved using a powerful computer. While there is no general analytical solution for
fully-turbulent flows, certain sub-models address phenomenon that do have analytical solutions, for example, one-dimensional heat conduction through
a solid. These analytical solutions can be used to test sub-models within a complex code such as FDS. The developers of FDS routinely use such
practices to verify the correctness of the coding of the model~\cite{Mell:1,McGrattan:4}. Such verification efforts are relatively simple and routine
and the results may not always be published nor included in the documentation. Examples of routine analytical testing include:
\begin{itemize}
\item The radiation solver has been verified with scenarios where
simple objects, like cubes or flat plates, are positioned in simple, sealed compartments. All convective motion is turned off, the object is given a
fixed surface temperature and emissivity of one (making it a black body radiator). The heat flux to the cold surrounding walls is recorded and
compared to analytical solutions.  These studies help determine the appropriate number of solid angles to be set as the default.
\item Solid objects are heated with a fixed heat flux, and the
interior and surface temperatures as a function of time are compared to analytical solutions of the one-dimensional heat transfer equation. These
studies help determine the number of nodes to use in the solid phase heat transfer model. Similar studies are performed to check the pyrolysis models
for thermoplastic and charring solids.
\item Early in its development, the hydrodynamic solver that evolved
to form the core of FDS was checked against analytical solutions of simplified fluid flow phenomena. These studies were conducted at the National
Bureau of Standards (NBS)\footnote{The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) was formerly known as the National Bureau of Standards.}
by Rehm, Baum and co-workers~\cite{Rehm:SIAM83,Rehm:SIAM84,Baum:CST84,Rehm:ANM85}. The emphasis of this early work was to test the stability and
consistency of the basic hydrodynamic solver, especially the velocity-pressure coupling that is vitally important in low Mach number applications.
Many numerical algorithms developed up to that point in time were intended for use in high-speed flow applications, like aerospace. Many of the
techniques adopted by FDS were originally developed for meteorological models, and as such needed to be tested to assess whether they would be
appropriate to describe relatively low-speed flow within enclosures.
\item A fundamental decision made by Rehm and Baum early in the FDS
development was to use a direct (rather than iterative) solver for the pressure. In the low Mach number formulation of the Navier-Stokes equations,
an elliptic partial differential equation for the pressure emerges, often referred to as the Poisson equation. Most CFD methods use iterative
techniques to solve the governing conservation equations to avoid the necessity of directly solving the Poisson equation. The reason for this is that
the equation is time-consuming to solve numerically on anything but a rectilinear grid. Because FDS is designed specifically for rectilinear grids,
it can exploit fast, direct solvers of the Poisson equation, obtaining the pressure field with one pass through the solver to machine accuracy. FDS
employs double-precision (8 byte) arithmetic, meaning that the relative difference between the computed and the exact solution of the discretized
Poisson equation is on the order of $10^{-12}$. The fidelity of the numerical solution of the entire system of equations is tied to the
pressure/velocity coupling because often simulations can involve hundreds of thousands of time steps, with each time step consisting of two solutions
of the Poisson equation to preserve second-order accuracy. Without the use of the direct Poisson solver, build-up of numerical error over the course
of a simulation could produce spurious results. Indeed, an attempt to use single-precision (4 byte) arithmetic to conserve machine memory led to
spurious results simply because the error per time step built up to an intolerable level.
\end{itemize}



\section{Numerical Tests}

\label{Numerical Tests}


Numerical techniques used to solve the governing equations within a model can be a source of error in the predicted results.  The hydrodynamic model
within FDS is second-order accurate in space and time.  This means that the error terms associated with the approximation of the spatial partial
derivatives by finite differences is of the order of the square of the grid cell size, and likewise the error in the approximation of the temporal
derivatives is of the order of the square of the time step. As the numerical grid is refined, the ``discretization error'' decreases, and a more
faithful rendering of the flow field emerges.  The issue of grid sensitivity is extremely important to the proper use of the model and will be taken
up in the next chapter.

A common technique of testing flow solvers is to systematically refine the numerical grid until the computed solution does not change, at which point
the calculation is referred to as a Direct Numerical Solution (DNS) of the governing equations.  For most practical fire scenarios, DNS is not
possible on conventional computers. However, FDS does have the option of running in DNS mode, where the Navier-Stokes equations are solved without
the use of sub-grid scale turbulence models of any kind. Because the basic numerical method is the same for LES and DNS, DNS calculations are a very
effective way to test the basic solver, especially in cases where the solution is steady-state. Throughout its development, FDS has been used in DNS
mode for special applications.  For example, FDS (or its core algorithms) have been used at a grid resolution of roughly 1~mm to look at flames
spreading over paper in a microgravity environment~\cite{McGrattan:C&F1996,Kashiwagi:CS1996,Mell:CS98,Mell:CS00,Prasad:CS2002,Nakamura:C&F2002}, as
well as "g-jitter" effects aboard spacecraft~\cite{Mell:g-jitter}. Simulations have been compared to experiments performed aboard the US Space
Shuttle.  The flames are laminar and relatively simple in structure, and the comparisons are a qualitative assessment of the model solution. Similar
studies have been performed comparing DNS simulations of a simple burner flame to laboratory experiments~\cite{Mukhopadhyay:1}. Another study
compared FDS simulations of a counterflow diffusion flames to experimental measurements and the results of a one-dimensional multi-step kinetics
model~\cite{Hamins:NASA}.

Early work with the hydrodynamic solver compared two-dimensional simulations of gravity currents with salt-water experiments~\cite{McGrattan:1}. In
these tests, the numerical grid was systematically refined until almost perfect agreement with experiment was obtained. Such convergence would not be
possible if there were a fundamental flaw in the hydrodynamic solver.




\section{Sensitivity Analysis}

A sensitivity  analysis considers the  extent to which  uncertainty in model  inputs influences  model output.  Model parameters  can  be the
physical properties of solids  and gases, boundary conditions, initial conditions, {\em  etc.} The parameters  can also be  purely numerical, like
the size  of the numerical grid. FDS  typically requires the user to  provide several  dozen different  types of  input  parameters that describe the
geometry, materials,  combustion phenomena, {\em etc.} By design,  the user  is  not expected  to  provide numerical  parameters besides the grid
size,  although the optional numerical parameters are described in both the Technical Reference Guide and the User's Guide.

FDS does not  limit the range of most of  the input parameters because applications often push beyond the  range for which the model has been
validated.  FDS is still used  for research at NIST and elsewhere, and the developers do not presume to know in all cases what the acceptable range
of   any  parameter  is.  Plus,  FDS   solves  the  fundamental conservation  equations  and  is   much  less  susceptible  to  errors resulting
from  input parameters  that  stray  beyond  the limits  of simpler empirical models.  However, the user is warned  that he/she is responsible for
the prescription of all parameters.   The FDS manuals can only provide guidance.

The grid size is the  most important numerical parameter in the model, as it  dictates the spatial  and temporal accuracy of  the discretized partial
differential equations.  The heat  release rate  is  the most important physical parameter,  as it is the source  term in the energy equation.
Property data, like  the thermal conductivity, density, heat of vaporization,  heat capacity, {\em  etc.}, ought to be  assessed in terms of their
influence on  the heat release rate. Validation studies have shown that FDS predicts well the transport of heat and smoke when the HRR is prescribed.
In  such cases, minor changes in the properties of  bounding  surfaces  do  not  have  a  significant  impact  on  the results. However, when the HRR
is not prescribed, but rather predicted by the  model using  the thermophysical properties  of the  fuels, the model output is sensitive to even
minor changes in these properties.

The sensitivity  analyses described in this chapter  are all performed in basically the same way. For a given scenario, best estimates of all the
relevant  physical  and  numerical  parameters are  made,  and  a ``baseline'' simulation is performed. Then, one by one, parameters are varied by a
given percentage, and the changes in predicted results are recorded.  This is  the simplest  form of  sensitivity  analysis. More sophisticated
techniques that involve  the simultaneous  variation of several  parameters  are impractical  with  a  CFD  model because  the computation time is
too long and the number of parameters too large to perform  the  necessary  number  of calculations  to  generate  decent statistics.



\subsection{Grid Sensitivity}

\label{gridsen}

The most  important decision made by a  model user is the  size of the numerical grid. In  general, the finer the numerical  grid, the better the
numerical solution of  the equations. FDS is second-order accurate in  space and  time,  meaning that  halving  the grid  cell size  will decrease
the discretization  error in  the governing  equations  by a factor  of 4.  Because  of  the non-linearity  of  the equations,  the decrease in
discretization error does not necessarily translate into a comparable decrease  in the error of  a given FDS  output quantity. To find out  what
effect a  finer grid has  on the solution,  model users usually  perform some  form of  grid  sensitivity study  in which  the numerical grid  is
systematically refined until  the output quantities do not change  appreciably with each refinement. Of  course, with each halving of  the grid cell
size,  the time required  for the simulation increases by  a factor of $2^4=16$  (a factor of two  for each spatial coordinate, plus  time). In  the
end, a  compromise is  struck between model accuracy and computer capacity.

Some   grid    sensitivity   studies   have    been   documented   and published. Since FDS was  first publicly released in 2000, significant changes
in  the   combustion  and   radiation  routines   have  been incorporated into the model. However, the basic transport algorithm is the  same, as  is
the  critical importance  of  grid sensitivity.  In compiling   sensitivity  studies,   only  those   that   examined  the sensitivity of routines no
longer used have been excluded.

As part of  a project to evaluate  the use of FDS version  1 for large scale   mechanically  ventilated   enclosures,  Friday~\cite{Friday:1}
performed a  sensitivity analysis to find  the approximate calculation time based on varying grid sizes. A propylene fire with a nominal heat release
rate was  modeled in FDS. There was  no mechanical ventilation and  the fire  was assumed  to grow  as a  function of  the  time from ignition
squared.  The  compartment  was   a  3~m  by  3~m  by  6.1~m space. Temperatures  were sampled 12~cm  below the ceiling.  Four grid sizes   were
chosen  for   the   analysis:   30~cm,  15~cm,   10~cm, 7.5~cm. Temperature  estimates were  not found to  change dramatically with different grid
dimensions.

Using FDS  version 1, Bounagui {\em  et al.}~\cite{Bounagui:1} studied the effect of grid size on simulation results to determine the nominal grid
size for future work. A propane burner 0.1~m by 0.1~m was modeled with  a heat  release rate  of  1500~kW.   A similar analysis was performed using
Alpert's ceiling  jet correlation~\cite{SFPE:Alpert}  that also showed better  predictions   with smaller grid sizes.  In a  related study,  Bounagui
{\em  et al.}~\cite{Bounagui:2} used  FDS to  evaluate  the emergency  ventilation  strategies in  the Louis-Hippolyte-La Fontaine Tunnel in
Montreal, Canada.


Xin~\cite{Xin:NFPA2004}  used FDS  to  model a  methane fueled  square burner (1~m  by 1~m) in  the open. Engineering correlations  for plume
centerline temperature and velocity  profiles were compared with model predictions to assess the influence of the numerical grid and the size of the
computational domain. The  results showed that FDS is sensitive to grid size effects, especially  in the region near the fuel surface, and domain
size  effects when the domain width is  less than twice the plume  width.  FDS  uses   a  constant  pressure  assumption  at  open boundaries.  This
assumption  will affect  the plume  behavior  if the boundary of the computational domain is too close to the plume.

Ierardi  and Barnett~\cite{Ierardi:1} used  FDS version  3 to  model a 0.3~m square methane diffusion burner with heat release rate values in the
range of 14.4~kW to 57.5~kW. The physical domain used was 0.6~m by 0.6~m with uniform grid spacings of  15, 10, 7.5, 5, 3, 1.5~cm for all three
coordinate  directions. For both  fire sizes, a grid  spacing of 1.5~cm  was found  to  provide  the best  agreement  when compared  to McCaffrey's
centerline    plume    temperature     and    velocity correlations~\cite{SFPE:Heskestad}.  Two similar  scenarios  that form the basis for Alpert's
ceiling  jet correlation were also modeled with FDS. The first scenario was a  1~m by 1~m, 670~kW ethanol fire under a 7~m   high  unconfined
ceiling.   The  planar   dimensions  of   the computational domain were 14~m by  14~m. Four uniform grid spacings of 50, 33.3, 25, and 20~cm were
used in the modeling. The best agreement for  maximum  ceiling  jet  temperature  was  with  the  33.3~cm  grid spacing. The best  agreement for
maximum ceiling jet  velocity was for the  50~cm grid  spacing. The  second scenario  was a  0.6~m  by 0.6~m 1000~kW ethanol fire under a 7.2~m high
unconfined ceiling. The planar dimensions of  the computational domain  were 14.4~m by  14.4~m. Three uniform  grid  spacings  of  60,  30,  and
20~cm  were  used  in  the modeling. The  results show that  the 60~cm grid spacing  exhibits the best  agreement with  the correlations  for both
maximum  ceiling jet temperature and velocity on a qualitative basis.

Petterson~\cite{Petterson:1} also completed work assessing the optimal grid size for FDS version 2. The FDS model predictions of varying grid sizes
were  compared to two separate fire  experiments: The University of Canterbury  McLeans Island  Tests and the  US Navy Hangar  Tests in Hawaii.  The
first  set  of  tests utilized  a  room with  approximate dimensions of  2.4~m by  3.6~m by  2.4~m and fire  sizes of  55~kW and 110~kW. The  Navy
Hangar  tests were performed  in a  hangar measuring 98~m by 74~m by 15~m in height and had fires in the range of 5.5~MW to 6.6~MW. The results  of
this study indicate that  FDS simulations with grids of 0.15~m had temperature predictions as accurate as models with grids as  small as 0.10~m. Each
of these grid  sizes produced results within   15~\%   of   the   University   of   Canterbury   temperature measurements. The 0.30~m grid  produced
less accurate results. For the comparison of the Navy Hangar tests, grid sizes ranging from 0.60~m to 1.80~m yielded results of comparable accuracy.

Musser~{\em et  al.}~\cite{Musser:1} investigated  the use of  FDS for course grid  modeling of non-fire and fire  scenarios. Determining the
appropriate  grid  size was  found  to  be  especially important  with respect  to heat  transfer  at heated  surfaces.  The convective  heat
transfer  from the  heated surfaces  was most  accurate when  the near surface grid cells were smaller than the depth of the thermal boundary layer.
However, a  finer grid  size  produced better  results at  the expense of computational time. Accurate contaminant dispersal modeling required a
significantly finer grid. The results of her study indicate that  non-fire simulations  can be  completed more  quickly  than fire simulations
because  the time  step is not  limited by the  large flow speeds in a fire plume.


\subsection{Sensitivity of Large Eddy Simulation Parameters}

FDS  uses the  Smagorinsky form  of  the Large  Eddy Simulation  (LES) technique.  This  means  that   instead  of  using  the  actual  fluid
viscosity, the model uses a viscosity of the form
\be
  \mu_{\hbox{\tiny LES}} =  \rho \,  (C_s\, \Delta)^2  \, |S|
\ee
where $C_s$  is an empirical constant, $\Delta$ is a length on the order of the size of a grid  cell,  and  the  deformation   term  $|S|$  is  related  to  the Dissipation Function (see FDS Technical Reference Guide~\cite{FDS_Tech_Guide_5} for details). Related to the ``turbulent  viscosity'' are  comparable
expressions  for  the thermal conductivity  and  material diffusivity:  \be  k_{\hbox{\tiny LES}}  = \frac{\mu_{\hbox{\tiny  LES}}   \;  c_p}{\PR_t}
\quad   ;  \quad  (\rho D)_{\hbox{\tiny  LES}}  =\frac{\mu_{\hbox{\tiny  LES}}}{\SC_t}  \ee  where $\PR_t$ and $\SC_t$ are the turbulent Prandtl and Schmidt numbers, respectively.  Thus, $C_s$, $\PR_t$  and $\SC_t$ are  a set  of  empirical constants.  Most  FDS users
simply use  the default values  of (0.2,0.5,0.5), but some have  explored their effect on the solution of the equations.

In an effort  to validate FDS with some  simple room temperature data, Zhang~{\em et al.}~\cite{Zhang:2}  tried different combinations of the
Smagorinsky parameters,  and suggested the current  default values. Of the  three parameters,  the  Smagorinsky constant  $C_s$  is the  most
sensitive.   Smagorinsky~\cite{Smagorinsky:1}  originally  proposed  a value of 0.23,  but researchers over the past  three decades have used values
ranging  from 0.1  to 0.23. There  are also refinements  of the original  Smagorinsky  model~\cite{Deardorff:1,Germano:1,Lilly:1} that do  not
require the  user  to  prescribe  the constants,  but  rather generate them automatically as part of the numerical scheme.

\subsection{Sensitivity of Radiation Parameters}

Radiative heat  transfer is  included in FDS  via the solution  of the radiation  transport equation for  a non-scattering  gray gas,  and in some
limited  cases using  a wide band  model. The equation  is solved using  a technique  similar to  finite volume  methods  for convective transport,
thus the  name given  to it  is the  Finite  Volume Method (FVM).  There  are  several  limitations  of  the  model.  First,  the absorption
coefficient  for the smoke-laden gas is  a complex function of  its  composition  and   temperature.  Because  of  the  simplified combustion  model,
the  chemical  composition of  the  smokey  gases, especially  the  soot content,  can  effect  both  the absorption  and emission  of thermal
radiation.  Second, the  radiation transport  is discretized via  approximately 100 solid angles. For  targets far away from  a  localized source  of
radiation,  like  a growing  fire,  the discretization can  lead to a non-uniform distribution  of the radiant energy. This can be seen in the
visualization of surface temperatures, where  ``hot spots'' show  the effect  of the  finite number  of solid angles. The  problem can  be lessened
by  the inclusion of  more solid angles, but at  a price of longer computing times.  In most cases, the radiative flux  to far-field targets is  not
as important  as those in the near-field, where coverage by the default number of angles is much better.

Hostikka {\em et al.} examined the sensitivity of the radiation solver to changes in  the assumed soot production, number  of spectral bands, number
of control  angles, and  flame temperature.  Some of  the more interesting findings were:
\begin{itemize}
\item  Changing  the  soot  yield  from 1~\%  to  2~\%  increased  the
radiative flux from a simulated methane burner about 15~\%
\item Lowering  the soot  yield to zero  decreased the  radiative flux
about 20~\%.
\item Increasing  the number of  control angles by  a factor of  3 was
necessary  to  ensure  the  accuracy  of the  model  at  the  discrete measurement locations.
\item Changing the number of spectral  bands from 6 to 10 did not have
a strong effect on the results.
\item Errors of 100~\% in heat  flux were caused by errors of 20~\% in
absolute temperature.
\end{itemize}
The  sensitivity  to  flame   temperature  and  soot  composition  are consistent with  combustion theory, which states that  the source term of the
radiative transport equation  is a function of  the absorption coefficient  multiplied  by the  absolute  temperature  raised to  the fourth  power.
The  number of  control angles  and spectral  bands are user-controlled numerical  parameters whose sensitivities  ought to be checked  for  each
new  scenario.  The  default  values  in  FDS  are appropriate for  most large scale fire  scenarios, but may  need to be refined for  more detailed
simulations  such as a  low-sooting methane burner.


\subsection{Sensitivity of Thermophysical Properties of Solid Fuels}

An  extensive amount  of  verification and  validation  work with  FDS version 4  has been  performed by Hietaniemi,  Hostikka, and  Vaari at VTT,
Finland~\cite{Hietaniemi:1}. The case  studies are  comprised of fire  experiments   ranging  in   scale  from  the   cone  calorimeter (ISO~5660-1)
to  full-scale fire  tests such as  the room  corner test (ISO~9705).  Comparisons are also  made between  FDS results  and data obtained  in the
SBI (Single  Burning Item)  Euro-classification test apparatus (EN  13823) as  well as  data obtained in  two {\em  ad hoc} experimental
configurations:  one is similar  to the room  corner test but has only  partial linings and the other is a  space to study fires in building
cavities.

All of the  case studies involve real materials  whose properties must be prescribed  so as to conform  to the assumption in  FDS that solids are of
uniform composition backed by a material that is either cold or totally insulating. Sensitivity of the various physical properties and the boundary
conditions were tested. Some of the findings were:
\begin{itemize}
\item  The measured  burning  rates of  various  materials often  fell
between two FDS  predictions in which cold or  insulated backings were assumed for the solid surfaces. FDS lacks a multi-layer solid model.
\item  The ignition  time of  upholstery is  sensitive to  the thermal
properties  of the  fabric covering,  but the  steady burning  rate is sensitive to the properties of the underlying foam.
\item Moisture content of wooden fuels is very important and difficult
to measure.
\item Flame spread  over complicated objects, like cables  laid out in
trays, can be modeled if the  surface area of the simplified object is comparable to that  of the real object. This  suggests sensitivity not only to
physical properties,  but also geometry.  It is  difficult to quantify the extent of the geometrical sensitivity.
\end{itemize}
There is  little quantification of  the observed sensitivities  in the study. Fire  growth curves can be  linear to exponential  in form, and small
changes in  fuel  properties  can lead  to  order of  magnitude changes  in heat  release rate  for unconfined  fires. The  subject is
discussed  in the  FDS  Validation Guide (Volume 3 of the Technical Reference Guide).
where it is  noted in many of the studies  that predicting fire growth is difficult.

Recently, Lautenberger, Rein and Fernandez-Pello~\cite{Lautenberger:FSJ} developed a method to automate the
process of  estimating material properties to input  into FDS. The methodology involves simulating a  bench-scale test with the model and iterating
via a  "genetic"  algorithm  to obtain  an  optimal set  of material  properties for  that  particular item.  Such techniques  are necessary because
most bench-scale apparatus do not provide a complete set of thermal properties.



\section{Code Checking}
\label{Code Checking}

An examination of the structure of the computer program can be used to detect potential errors in the numerical solution of the governing equations.
The coding can be verified by a third party either manually or automatically with profiling programs to detect irregularities and
inconsistencies~\cite{ASTM:E1355}.

At NIST and elsewhere, FDS has been compiled and run on computers manufactured by IBM, Hewlett-Packard, Sun Microsystems, Digital Equipment
Corporation, Apple, Silicon Graphics, Dell, Compaq, and various other personal computer vendors. The operating systems on these platforms include
Unix, Linux, Microsoft Windows, and Mac OSX. Compilers used include Lahey Fortran, Digital Visual Fortran, Intel Fortran, IBM XL Fortran, HPUX
Fortran, Forte Fortran for SunOS, the Portland Group Fortran, and several others. Each combination of hardware, operating system and compiler
involves a slightly different set of compiler and run-time options and a rigorous evaluation of the source code to test its compliance with the
Fortran 90 ISO/ANSI standard~\cite{F90}. Through this process, out-dated and potentially harmful code is updated or eliminated, and often the code is
streamlined to improve its optimization on the various machines. However, simply because the FDS source code can be compiled and run on a wide
variety of platforms does not guarantee that the numerics are correct. It is only the starting point in the process because it at least rules out the
possibility that erratic or spurious results are due to the platform on which the code is running.

Beyond hardware issues, there are several useful techniques for checking the FDS source code that have been developed over the years. One of the
best ways is to exploit symmetry. FDS is filled with thousands of lines of code in which the partial derivatives in the conservation equations are
approximated as finite differences. It is very easy in this process to make a mistake. Consider, for example, the finite difference approximation of
the thermal diffusion term in the $ijk$th cell of the three-dimensional grid:
\begin{eqnarray*}
(\nabla \cdot k \nabla T)_{ijk} &\approx&
              \frac{1}{\dx}
         \left[k_{i+\ha,jk}\frac{T_{i+1,jk}-T_{ijk}}{\dx}
              -k_{i-\ha,jk}\frac{T_{ijk}-T_{i-1,jk}}{\dx}\right]+  \nonumber \\
            &&\frac{1}{\dy}
         \left[k_{i,j+\ha,k}\frac{T_{i,j+1,k}-T_{ijk}}{\dy}
              -k_{i,j-\ha,k}\frac{T_{ijk}-T_{i,j-1,k}}{\dy}\right]+ \nonumber \\
            &&\frac{1}{\dz}
         \left[k_{ij,k+\ha}\frac{T_{ij,k+1}-T_{ijk}}{\dz}
              -k_{ij,k-\ha}\frac{T_{ijk}-T_{ij,k-1}}{\dz}\right]
\end{eqnarray*}
which is written as follows in the Fortran source code:
\begin{verbatim}
      DTDX = (TMP(I+1,J,K)-TMP(I,J,K))*RDXN(I)
      KDTDX(I,J,K) = .5*(KP(I+1,J,K)+KP(I,J,K))*DTDX
      DTDY = (TMP(I,J+1,K)-TMP(I,J,K))*RDYN(J)
      KDTDY(I,J,K) = .5*(KP(I,J+1,K)+KP(I,J,K))*DTDY
      DTDZ = (TMP(I,J,K+1)-TMP(I,J,K))*RDZN(K)
      KDTDZ(I,J,K) = .5*(KP(I,J,K+1)+KP(I,J,K))*DTDZ

      DELKDELT = (KDTDX(I,J,K)-KDTDX(I-1,J,K))*RDX(I) +
     .           (KDTDY(I,J,K)-KDTDY(I,J-1,K))*RDY(J) +
     .           (KDTDZ(I,J,K)-KDTDZ(I,J,K-1))*RDZ(K)
\end{verbatim}
This is one of the simpler constructs because the pattern that emerges within the lines of code make it fairly easy to check. However, a mis-typing
of an {\ct I} or a {\ct J}, a plus or a minus sign, or any of a hundred different mistakes can cause the code to fail, or worse produce the wrong
answer. A simple way to eliminate many of these mistakes is to run simple scenarios that have perfectly symmetric initial and boundary conditions.
For example, put a hot cube in the exact center of a larger cold compartment, turn off gravity, and watch the heat diffuse from the hot cube into the
cold gas. Any simple error in the coding of the energy equation will show up almost immediately. Then, turn on gravity, and in the absence of any
coding error, a perfectly symmetric plume will rise from the hot cube. This checks both the coding of the energy and the momentum equations. Similar
checks can be made for all of the three dimensional finite difference routines. So extensive are these types of checks that the release version of
FDS has a routine that generates a tiny amount of random noise in the initial flow field so as to eliminate any false symmetries that might arise in
the numerical solution.

The process of adding new routines to FDS is as follows: typically the routine is written by one person (not necessarily a NIST staffer) who takes
the latest version of the source code, adds the new routine, and writes a theoretical and numerical description for the FDS Technical Reference
Guide, plus a description of the input parameters for the FDS User's Guide. The new version of FDS is then tested at NIST with a number of benchmark
scenarios that exercise the range of the new parameters.  Provisional acceptance of the new routine is based on several factors: (1) it produces more
accurate results when compared to experimental measurement, (2) the theoretical description is sound, and (3) any empirical parameters are obtainable
from the open literature or standard bench-scale apparatus.  If the new routine is accepted, it is added to a test version of the software and
evaluated by external users and/or NIST grantees whose research is related to the subject. Assuming that there are no intractable issues that arise
during the testing period, the new routine eventually becomes part of the release version of FDS.

Even with all the code checking performed at NIST, it is still possible for errors to go unnoticed. One remedy is the fact that the source code for
FDS is publicly released. Although it consists of on the order of 30,000 lines of Fortran statements, various researchers outside of NIST have been
able to work with it, add enhancements needed for very specific applications or for research purposes, and report back to the developers bugs that
have been detected. The source code is organized into 27 separate files, each containing subroutines related to a particular feature of the model,
like the mass, momentum, and energy conservation equations, sprinkler activation and sprays, the pressure solver, {\em etc.} The lengthiest routines
are devoted to input, output and initialization.  Most of those working with the source code do not concern themselves with these lengthy routines
but rather focus on the finite-difference algorithm contained in a few of the more important files. Most serious errors are found in these files, for
they contain the core of the algorithm. The external researchers provide feedback on the organization of the code and its internal documentation,
that is, comments within the source code itself.  Plus, they must compile the code on their own computers, adding to its portability.



\chapter{The Basic Flow Solver}

\section{Single Mesh, Nonreacting Periodic Test Cases}

In this section we present test cases aimed at exercising the advective, pressure and viscous terms and the time integration for nonreacting flows with periodic boundary conditions in all directions (this eliminates the possibility of gravitational stratification).  In Section \ref{ns2d} we present an analytical solution that is useful for confirming the convergence rates of the truncation errors in the discretization schemes.  In Section \ref{decaying_isotropic_turbulence} we present a canonical flow for LES which tests that the subgrid stress model has been coded properly.

\subsection{2D Analytical Solution to Navier-Stokes}
\label{ns2d}

The velocity is given by $\mathbf{u} = [u, v]^T$. Let $A$ represent an arbitrary amplitude.  The kinematic viscosity and pressure are denoted $\nu$ and $p$, respectively, and the solution the 2D incompressible Navier-Stokes equations,
\begin{equation}
\label{eqn_NS}
\frac{\partial \mathbf{u}}{\partial t} + \mathbf{u} \cdot \nabla \mathbf{u} = - \nabla{p} + \nu \nabla^2 \mathbf{u} \,\mbox{,}
\end{equation}
is given by \cite{McDermott:NS2D}
\begin{eqnarray}
\label{eqn_usoln}
u(x,y,t) &=& 1 - A\cos(x-t)\sin(y-t)\,e^{-2\nu t} \,\mbox{,} \\
v(x,y,t) &=& 1 + A\sin(x-t)\cos(y-t)\,e^{-2\nu t} \,\mbox{,}
\end{eqnarray}
\begin{equation}
p(x,y,t) = -\frac{A^2}{4} \left[ \cos(2(x-t))+\cos(2(y-t))\right]e^{-4\nu t} \,\mbox{.}
\end{equation}
Note that this solution satisfies continuity for all time,
\begin{equation}
\label{eqn_divfree}
\nabla\cdot\mathbf{u} = 0 \,\mbox{,}
\end{equation}
is period on an interval $2\pi$ in each direction, and is time periodic on $2\pi$ if $\nu=0$, else the solution decays exponentially.  Below we present two series of tests which demonstrate the second-order accuracy of the FDS numerical scheme and thus provide a strong form of code verification for the advective and viscous terms which are exercised.

The physical domain of the problem is a square of side $L=2\pi$.  The grid spacing is uniform $\Delta x = \Delta y = L/N$ in each direction with $N =\{8,16,32,64\}$ for each test series.  The staggered grid locations are denoted $x_i = i \Delta x$ and $y_j = j \Delta y$, and the cell centers are marked by an overbar, $\bar{x}_i = x_i - \Delta x/2$ and $\bar{y}_j = y_j - \Delta y/2$.

First, we present qualitative results for the case in which $\nu=0$.  Thus, only the advective discretization and the time integration are being tested. Figure \ref{fig_ns2d_smv} shows the initial and final $(t=2\pi)$ numerical solution for the case $N=64$.  As mentioned, with $\nu=0$ the solution is periodic in time and this figure demonstrates that, as should be the case, the FDS numerical solution is unaltered after one flow-through time.

   \caption{\label{fig_ns2d_smv} \small Initial and final states of the $u$-component of velocity.}
\end{figure}

Next, in Figure \ref{fig_ns2d_timehistory}, we show time histories of the $u$-component of velocity at the center of the domain for the case in which $\nu = 0.1$.  It is clearly seen that the FDS solution (open circles) is converging to the analytical solution (solid line).

Progressing from left to right and top to bottom we have resolutions $N =\{8,16,32,64\}$ clearly showing convergence of the FDS numerical solution (open circles) to the analytical solution (solid line).  The case is run with constant properties, $\rho=1$ kg/m$^3$ and $\mu = 0.1$ kg/m/s, and a CFL of 0.25.}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig_ns2d_convergence} is the key quantitative result of this verification test.  In this figure we plot the rms error, $\varepsilon_{\mbox{\scriptsize rms}}$, in the $u$-component of velocity against the grid spacing.  The error is defined by
\begin{equation}
\label{eqn_rmserror}
\varepsilon_{\mbox{\scriptsize rms}} \equiv \sqrt{ \frac{1}{M} \sum_{k=1}^{M} \left[ U_{ij}^k - u(x_i,\bar{y}_j,t_k) \right]^2 } \,\mbox{,}
\end{equation}
where $M$ is the number of time steps and $k$ is the time step index.  The spatial indices are $(i=N/2,j=N/2)$ and $U_{ij}^k$ represents the FDS value for the $u$-component of velocity at the staggered storage location for cell $(i,j)$ at time step $k$; $u(x_i,\bar{y}_j,t_k)$ is the analytical solution for the $u$-component at the corresponding location in space and time.  The figure confirms that the advective terms, the viscous terms, and the time integration in the FDS code are convergent and second-order accurate.

(Right) Same case, except $\nu=0.1$, showing that the viscous terms in the FDS code are second-order accurate.}
\end{figure}


\subsection{Decaying Isotropic Turbulence}
\label{decaying_isotropic_turbulence}

In some cases the difference between verification and validation is not so clear.  Once a model is well-established and validated it may actually be used as a form of verification.  Granted, such a test is not as strong a verification as the convergence study shown in Section \ref{ns2d}.  Nevertheless, these tests are often quite useful in discovering problems within the code.  The case we examine in this section, decaying isotropic turbulence, is highly sensitive to errors in the advective and diffusive terms because the underlying physics is inherently three-dimensional and getting the problem right depends strongly on a delicate balance between vorticity dynamics and dissipation.  An even more subtle yet extremely powerful verification test is also presented in this section when we set both the molecular and turbulent viscosities to zero and confirm that the integrated kinetic energy within the domain remains constant.   In the absence of any form of viscosity, experience has shown that the slightest error in the advective terms or the pressure projection will cause the code to go unstable.  This verification is therefore stronger than one might initially expect.

In this section we test the FDS model against the low Reynolds number (Re) data of Comte-Bellot and Corrsin (CBC) \cite{CBC}. Viscous effects are important in this data set for a well-resolved LES, testing the model's Re dependence.  Following \cite{SdBK}, we use a periodic box of side $L = 9 \times 2\pi$ centimeters ($\approx 0.566$ m) and $\nu = 1.5 \times 10^{-5}$ $\mbox{m}^2/\mbox{s}$ for the kinematic viscosity. The non-dimensional times for this data set are: $x/M = 42$ (initial condition), $98$, and $171$, where $M$ is the characteristic mesh spacing of the CBC wind tunnel and $x$ is the downstream location of the data station. Considering the mean velocity in the CBC wind tunnel experiment, these correspond to dimensional times of $t = 0.00$, $0.28$, and $0.66$ seconds in our simulations.

The initial condition for the FDS simulation is generated by superimposing Fourier modes with random phases such that the spectrum matches that of the initial CBC data.  An iterative procedure is employed where the field is allowed to decay for small time increments subject to Navier-Stokes physics, each wavenumber is then injected with energy to again match the initial filtered CBC spectrum.  The specific filter used here is discussed in \cite{McDermott:2005b}.

To provide the reader with a qualitative sense of the flow, Figure \ref{fig_cbc_smv} shows the initial and final states of the velocity field in the 3D periodic domain.  The flow is unforced and so if viscosity is present the total energy decays with time due to viscous dissipation.  Because the viscous scales are unresolved, a subgrid stress model is required. Here the stress is closed using the gradient diffusion hypothesis and the eddy viscosity is modeled by the constant coefficient Smagorinsky model with the coefficient taken to be $C_s = 0.2$ (see the Technical Reference Guide for further details).

The decay curves for two grid resolutions are shown plotted on the left in Figure \ref{fig_cbc_energy}.  For an LES code such as FDS which uses a physically-based subgrid model, an important verification test is to run this periodic isotropic turbulence simulation in the absence of both molecular and turbulent viscosity.  For so-called ``energy-conserving'' explicit numerics the integrated energy will remain nearly constant in time.  This is demonstrated by the blue line in the top-left plot in Figure \ref{fig_cbc_energy}.  The deviations from identical energy conservation (to machine precision) are due solely to the time discretization (the spatial terms are conservative as discussed in \cite{Morinishi}) and converge to zero as the time step goes to the zero.  Note that strict energy conservation requires implicit time integration \cite{Ham,McDermott:2007b} and, as shown by the red curve on the same plot where only molecular viscosity is present in the simulation, this cost is unwarranted given that the molecular dissipation rate clearly overshadows the relatively insignificant amount of numerical dissipation caused by the explicit method.  The FDS result using the Smagorinsky eddy viscosity (the black solid line) matches the CBC data (red open circles) well for the $32^3$ case (top-left).  However, the FDS results are slightly too dissipative in the $64^3$ case (bottom-left).  This is due to a well-known limitation of the constant coefficient Smagorinsky model: namely, that the eddy viscosity does not converge to zero at the appropriate rate as the filter width (here equivalent to the grid spacing) is decreased.
\begin{figure}[t]
   \begin{tabular*}{\textwidth}{l@{\extracolsep{\fill}}r}
      \scalebox{1.0}{ \includegraphics[height=2.25in]{FIGURES/cbc_0000.pdf} } &

   \end{tabular*}
   \caption{\label{fig_cbc_smv} \small Initial and final states of the isotropic turbulence field.}
\end{figure}

To the right of each decay curve plot in Figure \ref{fig_cbc_energy} is the corresponding spectral data comparison.  The three black solid lines are the CBC spectral data for the points in time corresponding to dimensional times of $t = 0.00$, $0.28$, and $0.66$ seconds in our simulations.  As described above, the initial FDS velocity field (represented by the black dots) is specified to match the CBC data up to the grid Nyquist limit.  From there the spectral energy decays rapidly as discussed in \cite{McDermott:2005b}.  For each of the spectral plots on the right, the results of interest are the values of the red and blue dots and how well these match up with the corresponding CBC data.  For the $32^3$ case (top-right) the results are remarkably good.  Interestingly, the results for the more highly resolved $64^3$ case are not as good.  This is because the viscous scales are rather well-resolved at the later times in the experiment and, as mentioned, it is well-known that the constant coefficient Smagorinsky model is too dissipative under such conditions.

Similarly, for the $64^3$ case (bottom), the CBC data are obtained from filtered spectra for an $N=64$ grid.  Notice that the integrated FDS results for the $32^3$ case compare better with the filtered CBC data than the $64^3$ results.  This is a well-known limitation of the constant coefficient Smagorinsky model: namely, that the eddy viscosity does not converge to zero at the appropriate rate as the filter width (here equivalent to the grid spacing) is decreased. (Right) Energy spectra for the $32^3$ case (top) and the $64^3$ case (bottom).  The solid black lines are the spectral data of Comte-Bellot and Corrsin at three different points in time corresponding to downstream positions in the turbulent wind tunnel.

The FDS energy spectra corresponding to the subsequent CBC data are shown by the red and blue dots.  }
\end{figure}

Overall, the agreement between the FDS simulations and the CBC data is satisfactory and any discrepancies can be explained by limitations of the model.  Therefore, as a verification the results here are positive in that nothing points to coding errors.

\be \bs \cdot \nabla I_{\la}(\bx,\bs) =
 -\Big[ \kappa(\bx,\la) + \sigma_s(\bx,\la) \Big] \;
I_\la(\bx,\bs) +B(\bx,\la) + \frac{\sigma_s(\bx,\la)}{4\pi}
\int_{4\pi}\Phi(\bs,\bs') \; I_{\la}(\bx,\bs') \; d\bs'
\label{RTEbasic} \ee
where $I_{\la}(\bx,\bs)$ is the radiation intensity at wavelength
$\la$, $\bs$ is the direction vector of the intensity,
$\kappa(\bx,\la)$ and $\sigma_s(\bx,\la)$ are the local absorption
and scattering coefficients,
respectively, and $B(\bx,\la)$ is the emission source term.
The integral on the
right hand side describes the in-scattering from other directions.
In the case of a non-scattering gas the RTE becomes
\be \bs \cdot \nabla I_{\la}(\bx,\bs) = \kappa(\bx,\la) \; \Big[ I_b(\bx)
- I_\la(\bx,\bs) \Big] \label{RTE} \ee
where $I_b(\bx)$ is the source term given by the Planck function (see below).

In practical simulations the spectral ($\la$) dependence cannot be solved
accurately. Instead, the radiation spectrum is divided into
a relatively small number of bands and a separate RTE is derived for
each band. The band specific RTE is
\be   \bs \cdot \nabla I_n(\bx,\bs) = \kappa_n(\bx) \;
        \left[ I_{b,n}(\bx) - I_n(\bx,\bs) \right],\;\; n = 1...N
\label{bandRTE} \ee
where $I_n$ is the intensity integrated over the band $n$, and $\kappa_n$
is the appropriate mean absorption coefficient inside the band. The
source term can be written as a fraction of the blackbody radiation
\be I_{b,n} = F_n(\la_{\rm min},\la_{\rm max}) \; \sigma \; T^4/\pi \ee
where $\sigma$ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.
The calculation of factors $F_n$ is explained in Ref.~\cite{Siegel:1}.
When the intensities corresponding to the bands are known, the total
intensity is calculated by summing over all the bands
\be I(\bx,\bs) = \sum_{n=1}^N I_n(\bx,\bs) \ee

There are numerous examples in the heat transfer literature of exact solutions, for simple configurations of hot and cold objects, of the radiation
transport equation.

\section{Radiation inside a box (\texorpdfstring{{\bf radiation\_in\_a\_box}}{radiation\_in\_a\_box}) }
\label{radiation_in_a_box}

This verification case tests the computation of three-dimensional configuration factor $\Phi$ inside a cube box with one hot wall and five cold (0~K)

The configuration factors are calculated at the diagonal of the cold wall opposite to the hot wall. The exact values of the configuration factor from
plane element $dA$ to parallel rectangle $H$ are calculated using the analytical solution~\cite{Siegel:1}

\section{Radiation from a plane layer (\texorpdfstring{{\bf radiation\_plane\_layer}}{radiation\_plane\_layer})}
\label{radiation_plane_layer}

This case tests the computation of three-dimensional radiation from a homogenous, infinitely wide layer of hot gases.  The temperature of
the layer is 1273.15~K and the absorption coefficient, $\kappa$, is varied. The thickness of the layer is fixed at 1~m, and the optical depth is $\tau = (1 \, \kappa)$~m$^{-1}$.
Wall temperatures are set to 0~K. The results are compared against the exact solution $S(\tau)$ presented in~\cite{Zeldovich:1}
\be S(\tau) = S_b\left[1-2E_3(\tau)\right] \ee
where $S_b = \sigma T^4$ is the black-body heat flux from the radiating plane and $E_3(\tau)$ is the exponential
integral function (order 3) of the optical depth $\tau$.

The FDS results are computed at two mesh resolutions in the $x$-direction (I=20 and I=150). For I=20, both one-band and six-band versions are
included to test the correct integration of heat fluxes over multiple bands. For I=20, 2-D versions are also computed (J=1). The limiting case, $\tau=\infty$,
using a solid wall of temperature 1273.15~K, is computed to test the wall heat flux computation. The exact values and FDS predictions of
the wall heat fluxes are given in the table below.

\section{Wall Internal Radiation (\texorpdfstring{{\bf wall\_internal\_radiation}}{wall\_internal\_radiation}) }
\label{wall_internal_radiation}


In-depth absorption of thermal radiation in a solid is computed using a two-flux model.  In this example, the accuracy of the two-flux model is tested in the
computation of the emissive flux from a 0.10~m thick, homogenous layer of material at a temperature of 1273.15~K surrounded by an ambient temperature of 10~K. The
absorption coefficient is varied to cover a range [0.01, 10] of optical depth, $\tau$.

The exact solutions for radiative flux are the analytical solutions of plane layer emission~\cite{Zeldovich:1}
\be S(\tau) = S_b\left[1-2E_3(\tau)\right] \ee
where $S_b = \sigma T^4$ is the black-body heat flux from the radiating plane and $E_3(\tau)$ is the exponential
integral function (order 3) of optical depth, $\tau$. The exact solutions and FDS results are shown in the table below.

\chapter{Heat Conduction}

This chapter contains examples that test the one-dimensional heat conduction solver in FDS.
A one-dimensional heat conduction equation for the solid phase
temperature $T_s(x,t)$ is applied in the direction $x$ pointing into
the solid (the point $x = 0$ represents the surface)
\be
  \rho_s c_s \; \dod{T_s}{t} = \dod{}{x} k_s \dod{T_s}{x} + \dq_s'''
  \label{1dheat}
\ee
In cylindrical and spherical coordinates, the heat conduction equation is written
\be
  \rho_s c_s \; \dod{T_s}{t} = \frac{1}{r} \, \dod{}{r}
  \left(rk_s \dod{T_s}{r} \right)+\dq_s'''
  \label{1dheatcyl} \quad ; \quad
  \rho_s c_s \; \dod{T_s}{t} = \frac{1}{r^2} \, \dod{}{r}
  \left(r^2k_s \dod{T_s}{r} \right)+\dq_s'''
  \label{1dheatcyl}
\ee
FDS offers the user these options, with the assumption that the
obstruction is not actually recti-linear, but rather cylindrical or
spherical in shape. This option is useful in describing the behavior
of small, complicated ``targets'' like cables or heat detection
devices.

\section{Simple Heat Conduction Through a Solid Slab (\texorpdfstring{{\bf heat\_conduction}}{heat\_conduction})}
\label{heat_conduction}

Analytical solutions of transient, one-dimensional heat conduction through a slab can be found in Refs.~\cite{Drysdale:1} and \cite{Carslaw:1}. Four
cases are examined here. In each, a slab of thickness $L=0.1$~m is exposed on one face to an air temperature of $T_g=120$~$^\circ$C. The other face
is insulated (adiabatic). The convective heat transfer from the gas to the slab is $\dq_c'' = h \, (T_g - T_s)$, where $h$ is constant, and $T_s$ is
the slab face temperature. No thermal radiation is included.

\section{Temperature-Dependent Thermal Properties (\texorpdfstring{{\bf heat\_conduction\_kc}}{heat\_conduction\_kc})}
\label{heat_conduction_kc}

This example demonstrates the 1-D heat conduction in cartesian, cylindrical and spherical geometries with temperature-dependent thermal properties.
The cartesian solution was computed using HEATING (version~7.3), a multi-dimensional, finite-difference, general purpose heat transfer
model~\cite{Childs}. The cylindrical and spherical solutions were computed using a commercial finite-element solver, ABAQUS.

The sample of homogenous material is initially at 0~$^\circ$C and at $t>0$ exposed to a gas at 700~$^\circ$C. A fixed heat transfer coefficient of
10~W/m$^2$/K is assumed. The density of the material is 10000~kg/m$^3$. The conductivity and specific heat are functions of temperature with the
following values: $k(0)=0.10$~W/m/K, $k(200)=0.20$~W/m/K, $c(0)=1.0$~kJ/kg/K, $c(100)=1.2$~kJ/kg/K, $c(200)=1.0$~kJ/kg/K. The thickness (radius) of
the sample is 0.01~m. In the cartesian case, the back surface of the material is exposed to a gas at 0~$^\circ$C. In the figure below, the light colored solid
lines are FDS results and the dark lines are the HEATING results. An example input with cylindrical geometry looks like:

\chapter{Pyrolysis}

Solids can undergo simultaneous reactions under the following assumptions:
\begin{itemize}
\setlength{\itemsep}{0.0in}
\item instantaneous release of volatiles from solid to the gas phase,
\item local thermal equilibrium between the solid and the volatiles,
\item no condensation of gaseous products, and
\item no porosity effects
\end{itemize}
Each material component may undergo several competing reactions, and
each of these reactions may produce some other solid component
(residue), gaseous fuel, and/or water vapor according to
the yield coefficients $\nu_s$, $\nu_f$ and $\nu_w$, respectively.
These coefficients should usually satisfy $\nu_s + \nu_f + \nu_w = 1$,
but smaller yields may also be used to take into account the gaseous
products that are not explicitly included in the simulation.

\section{A Simple Two-Step Pyrolysis Example (\texorpdfstring{{\bf two\_step\_solid\_reaction}}{two\_step\_solid\_reaction})}
\label{two_step_solid_reaction}

Consider  the set  of ordinary  differential equations  describing the mass  fraction of  three  components of  a  solid material  undergoing thermal
degradation:
\begin{eqnarray}
    \frac{dY_a}{dt} &=&  -K_{ab} Y_a \nonumber  \\
    \frac{dY_b}{dt} &=&   K_{ab} Y_a  -  K_{bc}  Y_b  \\
    \frac{dY_c}{dt} &=&   K_{bc} Y_a
    \nonumber
\end{eqnarray}
where  the  mass  fraction  of  component  $a$  is  1  initially.  The
analytical solution is:
\begin{eqnarray}
    Y_a(t)    &=&    \exp(-K_{ab}t)    \nonumber   \\
    Y_b(t)    &=&    \frac{K_{ab}}{K_{bc}-K_{ab}} \exp(-K_{ab} t)  - \exp(-K_{bc} t) \\
    Y_c(t)    &=&    \left[   K_{ab}    (1-\exp(-K_{bc} t) )    +  K_{bc}*(\exp(-K_{ab} t) -1) \right] / (K_{ab}-K_{bc})
\end{eqnarray}
The analytical and  numerical solution for the parameters $K_{ab} = 0.389$ and $K_{bc} = 0.262$ are shown here:

\section{Development of surface emissivity (\texorpdfstring{{\bf emissivity}}{emissivity})}
\label{emissivity}

For thermally thick surfaces, the surface emissivity is computed as a
mass-weighted sum of the individual material emissivities
in the first condensed phase grid cell. In the verification test, the
initial material, having emissivity of 1.0, is converted to another
material, having emissivity of 0.0, at a constant rate of 0.1~s$^{-1}$. As a
result, the surface emissivity should change linearly from 1.0 to 0.0 in 10~s.

\section{Enthalpy of solid materials (\texorpdfstring{{\bf enthalpy}}{enthalpy})}
\label{enthalpy}

Consider a thin plate of conductive material that is exposed on one side to an elevated temperature heat source and exposed on the
other to an ambient temperature void. In the thermally-thin limit, the temperature of the slab is governed by the following equation
\be
   \frac{dT_s}{dt} = \frac{\dq_{\hbox{\tiny front}}'' + \dq_{\hbox{\tiny back}}''}{c_s \, \rho_s \, \delta}
\ee
In this example, the initial exposure to the front side of the slab is
3~kW/m$^2$. The original material (call it A) undergoes a reaction to form material B.  The reaction rate is constant, 0.2~s$^{-1}$, which in this
case means that material A disappears in exactly 5~s. This is achieved by setting $n_s$ and $E$ to 0 and $A$ to 0.2 in the reaction rate term:
\be
    r = \left( \frac{\rho_{s,A}}{\rho_{s0}}\right)^{n_{s}}
    A \; \exp \left(-\frac{E}{RT_s}\right)
\ee
The density and conductivity of both materials are
30~kg/m$^3$ and 10~W/m/K, respectively. The emissivity of front and back is 1.  The specific heat of material A changes from
1.0~kJ/kg/K to 0.1~kJ/kg/K above 80~$^\circ$C, while the specific heat of material B is constant at 1.0~kJ/kg/K. The slab is 1~mm thick.

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=3.5in]{FIGURES/enthalpy}
\end{center}

\noindent
Note that the ``analytical'' solution is actually a simple numerical integration of the equations above with a small time step to ensure accuracy.
This example tests a number of features, including the reaction rate, mass weighted specific heats, and radiation boundary conditions. Note that the
convective heat transfer has been turned off, and the correct steady-state temperature is calculated by FDS.
