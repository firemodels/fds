Plan

1.  Use the Training_test directory to get the structure and file names tied down
(SVN had problems with the Training directory)

2.  Will be committing training files before they "ready" to make it easy to get files
to the linux cluster. (see 3)

3.  On cluster, write some scripts to make it easy to "push the button" to run all cases
