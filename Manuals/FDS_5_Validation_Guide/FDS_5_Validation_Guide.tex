\chapter{Preface}

This is Volume 3 of the FDS Technical Reference Guide. Volume 1 describes the mathematical model and numerical method. Volume 2 documents past and
present model verification work. Instructions for using FDS are contained in a separate User's Guide~\cite{FDS_Users_Guide_5}.

The FDS Technical Reference Guide is based in part on the ``Standard Guide for Evaluating the Predictive Capability of
Deterministic Fire Models,'' ASTM~E~1355~\cite{ASTM:E1355}. ASTM~E~1355 defines {\em model evaluation} as ``the process of quantifying the accuracy
of chosen results from a model when applied for a specific use.'' The model evaluation process consists of two main components: verification and
validation. {\em Verification} is a process to check the correctness of the solution of the governing equations. Verification does not imply that the
governing equations are appropriate; only that the equations are being solved correctly. {\em Validation} is a process to determine the
appropriateness of the governing equations as a mathematical model of the physical phenomena of interest. Typically, validation involves comparing
model results with experimental measurement. Differences that cannot be explained in terms of numerical errors in the model or uncertainty in the
measurements are attributed to the assumptions and simplifications of the physical model.

Evaluation is critical to establishing both the acceptable uses and limitations of a model. Throughout its development, FDS has undergone various
forms of evaluation, both at NIST and beyond. This volume provides a survey of validation work conducted to date to evaluate FDS.


\chapter{About the Authors}

\begin{description}
\item[Kevin McGrattan] is a mathematician in the Building and Fire
Research Laboratory of NIST. He received a bachelors of science degree
from the School of Engineering and Applied Science of Columbia
University in 1987 and a doctorate at the Courant Institute of New
York University in 1991. He joined the NIST staff in 1992 and has
since worked on the development of fire models, most notably the Fire
Dynamics Simulator.
\item[Randall McDermott] joined the research staff of the Building and Fire Research Lab in 2008. He received a bachelors of science from the University of Tulsa in
Chemical Engineering in 1994 and a doctorate at the University of Utah in 2005.
His research interests include subgrid-scale models and numerical methods for large-eddy simulation, adaptive mesh refinement, and Lagrangian particle methods.
\item[Simo Hostikka] is a Senior Research Scientist at VTT Technical
Research Centre of Finland. He received a master of science
(technology) degree in 1997 and a doctorate in 2008 from
the Department of Engineering Physics and Mathematics of the
Helsinki University of Technology.  He is the principal developer of the
radiation and solid phase sub-models within FDS.
\item[Jason Floyd] is a Senior Engineer at Hughes Associates, Inc., in
Baltimore, Maryland. He received a bachelors of science degree and a
doctorate from the Nuclear Engineering Program of the University of
Maryland. After graduating, he won a National Research Council
Post-Doctoral Fellowship at the Building and Fire Research Laboratory
of NIST, where he developed the combustion algorithm within FDS. He is
currently funded by NIST under grant 60NANB5D1205 from the Fire
Research Grants Program (15 USC 278f).  He is the principal developer
of the multi-parameter mixture fraction combustion model and control
logic within FDS.
\item[Kuldeep Prasad] is a Research Engineer in the Building and Fire Research
Laboratory at NIST. He received a bachelors of technology degree from Indian
Institute of Technology, Kanpur in 1986, and a doctorate at the Georgia Institute of
Technology in 1991. He joined the NIST staff in 2001 and has developed the multi-mesh
data structures and algorithms for coupling the meshes in the Fire Dynamics Simulator.

\chapter{Acknowledgments}

\label{acksection}

Support for validation experiments and the preparation of the FDS
manuals has been provided by the Office of Nuclear Regulatory Research
of the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission (US NRC). Special thanks to
Mark Salley and Jason Dreisbach for their efforts.

Anthony Hamins directed the NIST/NRC and WTC experiments, conducted smaller methane burner
measurements, and quantified the experimental uncertainty of these and other
experiments used in this study. Alex Maranghides was the Director of the Large Fire Laboratory at NIST at
the time these tests were conducted, and he helped to design the
experiments. Therese McAllister oversaw the instrumentation of the structural steel during the WTC experiments.

Anthony Hamins developed the technique of evaluating experimental uncertainty that is used throughout this Guide.
Blaza Toman of the Statistical Engineering Division of NIST developed the method of quantifying the
model error.

Rick Peacock of NIST assisted in the interpretation of results from
the ``NBS Multi-Room Test Series,'' a set of three room
fire experiments conducted at the National Bureau of Standards (now
NIST) in the mid-1980's.

Bryan Klein of NIST assisted in the development of techniques to automatically generate the plots that
are found throughout this Guide.

Thanks to Bill Pitts, Nelson Bryner, and Erik Johnsson of NIST for their contribution of data for the
''NIST Reduced Scale Enclosure Experiments.''

Thanks to VTT, Finland, for their contribution of experimental data,
referred to in this document as the ``VTT Large Hall Experiments.''
Also, Jukka Hietaniemi, Jukka Vaari and Timo Korhonen have
performed validation studies of various sub-models. The VTT Fire
Research group continues to work on model development and
validation of the model for various applications.

David Sheppard, currently of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF), conducted the
experiments referred to as the ``UL/NFPRF Test Series'' on behalf of the Fire Protection Research Foundation (then known as
the National Fire Protection Research Foundation) while working at Underwriters Labs in Northbrook, Illinois.
Sheppard, along with Bryan Klein of NIST, conducted the experiments referred to as the ``ATF Corridors'' series in 2008.

Thanks to Jerry Back, Craig Beyler and Phil DiNenno of Hughes Associates and Pat Tatem of
the Naval Research Laboratory for their contribution
of experimental data for the ``HAI/NRL Wall Fire'' series. Thanks also to Craig Beyler for assistance with the data
for the ``Beyler Hood Experiments.''

Thanks to Ken Steckler for providing details about the ``Steckler Compartment Experiments'' of 1979.

Jianping Zhang at the University of Ulster contributed heat flux measurements from the SBI apparatus.

At the University of Maryland, Professor Fred~Mowrer and Phil Friday
were the first to apply FDS to the NRC-sponsored experiments referred
to in this document as the ``FM/SNL Test Series'' (Factory Mutual and
Sandia National Laboratories conducted these experiments). Thanks also to
Steve Nowlen, the test director, for additional information.

Ulf Wickstr\"{o}m of SP, Sweden, contributed experimental data from a series of experiments (SP 2009 AST) that were designed to
evaluate the feasibility of using plate thermometer measurements as boundary conditions for a heat conduction calculation within several types of
steel beams. The adiabatic surface temperature concept was tested in both the experiments and model.
