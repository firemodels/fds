\section{Plume Temperatures}

For fire plumes, a measure of how well the flow field is resolved is given by the non-dimensional expression $D^*/\dx$, where $D^*$ is a characteristic
fire diameter
\be
   D^* = \left(
     \frac{\dQ}{\rho_\infty \, c_p \, T_\infty \, \sqrt{g} }
     \right)^\frac{2}{5}
\ee
and $\dx$ is the nominal size of a mesh cell\footnote{The characteristic fire diameter is related to the characteristic fire size via the relation $Q^* = (D^*/D)^{5/2}$, where $D$ is the physical diameter of the fire.}. The quantity $D^*/\dx$ can be thought of as the number of computational cells spanning the characteristic (not necessarily the physical) diameter of the fire. The more cells spanning the fire, the better the resolution of the calculation. It is better to assess the quality of the mesh in terms of this non-dimensional parameter, rather than an absolute mesh cell size. For example, a cell size of 10~cm may be ``adequate,'' in some sense, for evaluating the spread of smoke and heat through a building from a sizable fire, but may not be appropriate to study a very small, smoldering source. The resolution of all the numerical simulations included in this chapter is given in Table~\ref{Numerical_Parameters}.

\subsection{FM/SNL Experiments}

\label{FM/SNL_Plume}

The FM/SNL tests consisted of propylene gas burners, heptane pools, methanol pools, PMMA solids, as well as qualified and unqualified cables, burned in a large room which, for the first 18 tests, was free of obstructions. Plume Temperatures shown here were measured at approximately 6~m from the floor, or 0.98 times the total ceiling height. For Tests~1-5 and 7-9, the thermocouple station (Station~13) was centered above the fire pan. Tests~6 and 10-15 used an alternate fire location, centered along the south wall. Station~9 was not centered above these fires, but fell within the plume. Tests~16 and 17 had fires located in the south-west corner of the room, too remote from any stations to allow for plume measurements.

\subsection{NRCC Smoke Tower Experiments, Stairwell Plumes}

The NRCC Smoke Tower experiments include measurements of the temperature of smoke ascending a 10 story stairwell. This data is included here in the chapter on Fire Plumes because smoke movement in a vertical shaft with stairs can be considered an obstructed plume. Shown in Fig.~\ref{NRCC_Smoke_Tower_Stairwell} are predictions of gas temperature measurements made in the center of the stairwell approximately 1.8~m above the slab at floors 2-10. Note that the plot labels ``Slot'' refer to the data acquisition system in the experiments only and have no meaning in the present context. It should be clear from the plot title how the various curves ought to be interpreted.

\subsection{SP Adiabatic Surface Temperature Experiments}

Three experiments were conducted at SP, Sweden, in 2011, in which a 6~m long, 20~cm diameter vertical column was positioned in the middle of 1.1~m and 1.9~m diesel fuel and 1.1~m heptane
pool fires~\cite{Sjostrom:AST}. Gas, plate, and steel surface temperature measurements were made at heights of 1~m, 2~m, 3~m, 4~m, and 5~m above the pool surface. Gas temperatures were measured with 0.25~mm and 0.50~mm bead thermocouples. The results are very similar and only the 0.25~mm values are used. In the experiments, the fire was reported to lean. The lean was significant for the 1.9~m diesel fuel fire. In that case, only data from 1~m and 2~m above the pool are used. The average temperature between 10~min and 15~min is the basic of comparison.

\subsection{USN High Bay Hangar Experiments}

\label{USN_Plume}

A large number of plume temperature measurements are available from the US Navy experiments conducted at Keflavik, Iceland, and Barber's Point, Hawaii. The hangars were very large in size (22~m high in Iceland and 15~m high in Hawaii) and the heat release rates varied from 100~kW to 33~MW. All experiments made use of a fuel pan filled with either JP-5 or JP-8 jet fuel, positioned in the center of the hangar.

\subsection{VTT Large Hall Experiments}

\label{VTT_plume}

The VTT experiments consisted of liquid fuel pan fires positioned in the middle of a large fire test hall. Plume temperatures were measured at two heights above the fire, 6~m (T G.1) and 12~m (T G.2). The flames were observed to extend to about 4~m above the fire pan.

\section{Heskestad's Flame Height Correlation}

Table~\ref{Flame_Height_Parameters} lists the parameters for FDS simulations of fires in a 1~m by 1~m square pan\footnote{The effective diameter, $D$, of a 1~m square pan is 1.13~m, obtained by equating the area of a square and circle.}. Figure~\ref{Flame_Height_check_hrr} shows a verification of the heat release rate for each case, and Fig.~\ref{Flame_Height} compares the FDS predictions with Heskestad's empirical correlation. Note that the flame height for the FDS simulations is defined as the distance above the pan, on average, at which 99~\% of the fuel has been consumed. Note also that the simulations were run at three different grid resolutions. A convenient length scale is given by
\be
   D^* = (Q^*)^{2/5} \, D
\ee
Given a grid cell size, $\dx$, the three resolutions can be characterized by the non-dimensional quantity, $D^*/\dx$, whose values in these cases are 5, 10 and 20.

The flame height definition used in Fig.~\ref{Flame_Height} (99~\% fuel consumption) is admittedly arbitrary and is often questioned when FDS predictions of flame height are compared with experimental values, which are usually based on luminosity (effectively measuring radiation emission from soot).  Further, Heskestad's flame height correlation is one among many such correlations~\cite{SFPE:Heskestad,Steward:1970,Becker:1978,Cox:1985,Hasemi:1984,Cetegen:1984,Delichatsios:1984}, and the reported variation is significant, especially at low values of $Q^*$ where the details of the burner configuration (shape of the burner, etc.) become important.  To illustrate the uncertainty one can expect from FDS calculations and to test the sensitivity of the reported FDS results to the flame height definition, Fig.~\ref{Flame_Height2} shows two different FDS flame height predictions, one at 99~\% fuel consumption (as in Fig.~\ref{Flame_Height})---the red curve---and one using 95~\% fuel consumption---the blue curve.  Three different grid resolutions were run for each flame height definition.  For 99~\% fuel consumption, the red dashed line is the maximum flame height from the three resolutions.  For 95~\% fuel consumption, the blue dashed line is the minimum flame height from the three resolutions.  We also overlay several different flame height correlations (colored solid lines).

Figure~\ref{Flame_Structure} includes comparisons of the predicted HRR as a function of the height of the burner for three different values of $Q^*$. The experimental measurements were performed by Tamanini at Factory Mutual~\cite{Tamanini:CF1983}. Both the HRR and height above the burner have been non-dimensionalized by the total HRR and the flame height, respectively. These results demonstrate that the predicted spatial distribution of the energy release improves as the numerical grid is refined.

\section{Harrison Spill Plumes/Entrainment Experiments}
\label{Harrison_Spill_Plumes}
\label{Entrainment}

In each of these reduced-scale spill plume experiments, the entrained mass flow rate into the plume was measured at a series of heights by varying the flow through an exhaust hood to maintain a constant smoke layer depth.  Figure~\ref{Entrainment_Plot} compares measured and predicted entrainment rates at five different elevations for the fire scenarios labelled SE4 through SE21 in Ref.~\cite{Harrison:2009}. Two general configurations are considered -- one that is intended to mimic a balcony spill plume and one in which the plume adheres to a vertical wall above the compartment opening.

\section{Sandia Plume Experiments}

The Fire Laboratory for Accreditation of Models by Experimentation (FLAME) facility \cite{OHern:2005,Blanchat:2001} at Sandia National Laboratories in Albuquerque, New Mexico, is designed specifically for validating models of buoyant fire plumes.  The plume source is 1~m in diameter surrounded by a 0.5~m steel ``ground plane''. Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) and Planar Laser-Induced Fluorescence (PLIF) techniques were used to obtain instantaneous joint scalar and velocity fields.

\subsection{Sandia 1 m Helium Plume}
\label{Sandia plume}

Calculations of the Sandia 1 m helium plume are run at three grid resolutions: 6 cm, 3 cm, and 1.5 cm.  To give the reader with a qualitative feel for the results, Fig.~\ref{Sandia_He_1m_image} provides a snapshot of density contours from the simulation. The calculations are run in parallel on 16 processors; the outlined blocks indicate the domain decomposition.  Data for vertical velocity, radial velocity, and helium mass fraction are recorded at three levels downstream from the base of the plume, $z = [0.2, 0.4, 0.6]$ m, corresponding to the experimental measurements of O'Hern et al.~\cite{OHern:2005}.  Results for the mean and root mean square (RMS) profiles are given in Figs.~\ref{Sandia_He_1m_velocity} - \ref{Sandia_He_1m_massfraction}.  The means are taken between $t=10$ and $t=20$ seconds in the simulation.

The domain is 3~m by 3~m by 4~m. The boundary conditions are open on all sides with a smooth solid surface surrounding the 1~m diameter helium pool.  The ambient and helium mixture temperature is set to 12~$^\circ$C and the background pressure is set to 80900~Pa to correspond to the experimental conditions.  The helium/acetone/oxygen mixture molecular weight is set to 5.45~kg/kmol.  The turbulent Schmidt and Prandtl numbers are left at the FDS default value of 0.5.  The helium mixture mass flux is specified as 0.0605~kg/s/m$^2$. This case was studied previously by DesJardin et al.~\cite{DesJardin:2004}.

\subsection{Sandia 1 m Methane Pool Fire}
\label{Sandia_methane}

The Sandia 1 m methane pool fire series provides data for three methane flow rates: Test 14 (low flow rate), Test~24 (medium flow rate), and Test 17 (high flow rate) \cite{Tieszen:2004}.  The experiments are simulated using three grid resolutions: 6 cm, 3 cm, and 1.5 cm.  Fig.~\ref{Sandia_CH4_1m_image} provides a snapshot of temperature contours from the 1.5 cm Test 17 simulation. The calculations are run in parallel on 16 processors---a similar computational set up as the helium case (the experiments were run in the same facility at Sandia).  Data for vertical velocity and radial velocity are recorded at three levels downstream from the base of the plume, $z = [0.3, 0.5, 0.9]$ m.  Results for the mean profiles (and turbulent kinetic energy for Test 24) are given in Figs.~\ref{Sandia_CH4_1m_Test14_velocity} - \ref{Sandia_CH4_1m_Test17_velocity}.  The means are taken between $t=10$ and $t=20$ seconds in the simulation.

For Test 17, we recorded the vertical velocity as a time series in four locations in the plume---at two positions along the centerline and at two positions on the edge.  The time series from our 1.5 cm simulation at $x=0$ m and $z=0.5$ m, corresponding to Fig.~6 in \cite{Tieszen:2002}, is shown in Fig.~\ref{Sandia_CH4_1m_Test17_spectrum} along with the power spectrum from the average of the four time series locations.  The FDS results compare well with the experimentally obtained puffing frequency of 1.65 Hz \cite{Tieszen:2002}.

\subsection{Sandia 1 m Hydrogen Pool Fire}
\label{Sandia_hydrogen}

Sandia Test 35 \cite{Tieszen:2004} is simulated at three grid resolutions: 6 cm, 3 cm, and 1.5 cm.  The computational set up is nearly identical to the methane cases.  Results for mean vertical and radial velocity are given in Figs.~\ref{Sandia_H2_1m_Test35_velocity}.  Results for turbulent kinetic energy are presented in Fig.~\ref{Sandia_H2_1m_Test35_tke}.  Means are taken from a time average between $t=10$ and $t=20$ seconds in the simulation.

By examining movies of the simulation results we can see a qualitative difference between the methane and hydrogen cases.  The dynamics of the hydrogen case tend to dominated by near total consumption events which create blowback on the pool followed by streaks of accelerating buoyant flow which increase the mean vertical velocity.  An example of the consumption event is seen near the end of the case shown in Fig.~\ref{Sandia_H2_1m_image}.  It is possible that we have not run the simulation long enough for accurate statistics and that streaking events early in the time window (between 10-20 seconds) are biasing the mean vertical velocity to be too high, as is clear from the top-left plot in Fig.~\ref{Sandia_H2_1m_Test35_velocity}.

\section{UMD Line Burner}
\label{UMD_Line_Burner_plumes}

In this section, we present thermocouple temperature measurements and computational results for the UMD Line Burner.  Experimental details may be found in White et al.~\cite{White:2015}. FDS simulations are performed at three grid resolutions corresponding to $W/\delta x = 4, 8, 16$, where $W = 5$ cm is the width of the fuel slot in the line burner.  The radiant fraction is measured to be $\chi_{\si{r}} = 0.18$ for the 18 vol.~\% O$_2$ coflow.  We use this value in the simulations.

Fig.~\ref{UMD_Line_Burner_methane_O2_p18_TC} shows measured and computational results for mean thermocouple temperature across the width of the burner at two heights, $z$, above the burner surface. Fig.~\ref{UMD_Line_Burner_temp_slcf} shows a slice of gas temperature for the case with methane fuel and 18 vol.~\% O$_2$ in the coflow stream (nitrogen dilution).  The purpose of the image is to provide a qualitative result for the flame.

Within the slice plane blue represents 20 \si{\degree}C, red 1500 \si{\degree}C. }
