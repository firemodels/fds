=========
= About =
=========

Firebot is an automatic verification and validation test bot that is run at a regular interval (nightly).
More details on the Firebot build stages can be found in the FDS Configuration Management Plan.

============================
= Running Firebot Manually =
============================

1. su - firebot
2. cd ~/firebot
3. cd FDS-SMV
4. svn update
5. ./firebot_linux_wrapper.sh (or ./firebot_mac_wrapper.sh)

======================
= Installing Firebot =
======================

1. Create an account for Firebot on your machine. This account should be named 'firebot' if possible.
   The use of a separate account is recommended so that Firebot has a clean and undisturbed copy of
   the repositories to work with. Note that the account name should be a domain or functional account name
   for Matlab to work.

2. Ensure that the following software packages are installed on the system:

    Intel compilers and Intel Inspector
    Python
    LaTeX (TeX Live distribution), be sure to make this the default LaTeX in the system-wide PATH
    Matlab (test the command 'matlab')

3. Firebot uses email notifications for build status updates. Ensure that outbound emails can be sent using the 'mail' command.

4. Install libraries for Smokeview. On CentOS, you can use the following command:

    yum install mesa-libGL-devel mesa-libGLU-devel libXmu-devel libXi-devel xorg-x11-server-Xvfb

5. Add the following lines to firebot's ~/.bashrc file:

    . /usr/local/Modules/3.2.10/init/bash
    module load null modules torque-maui mpi/openmpi-1.8.1-gnu-ib

    export IFORT_COMPILER=/opt/intel/composerxe
    export IFORT_COMPILER_LIB=/opt/intel/composerxe/lib

    #FDS
    source ~/.bashrc_fds intel64

    # Set unlimited stack size
    ulimit -s unlimited

6. Setup passwordless SSH on the firebot account. Generate SSH keys and ensure that the head node can SSH into all of the compute nodes. Also, make sure that firebot's account information is propagated across all compute nodes (e.g., with the passsync or authcopy command).

7. Ensure that a queue named 'firebot' is created, enabled, and started in the torque queueing system and that nodes are defined for this queue. Test the 'qstat' command on firebot's account.

8. In Firebot's home directory, perform an SVN checkout on the Firebot portion of the FDS-SMV repository using the below command.

    svn checkout https://fds-smv.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/FDS/trunk/Utilities/Firebot/ firebot --username fds.firebot

9. In Firebot's home directory, perform an SVN checkout of the entire FDS-SMV repository using the below command. You should perform a test commit to the FDS-SMV repository to ensure that firebot's SVN password has been stored locally and that it can commit changes.

    svn checkout https://fds-smv.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/FDS/trunk/ FDS-SMV --username fds.firebot

10. cd to the newly created ~/firebot directory

11. Run the ./firebot_linux_wrapper.sh or ./firebot_mac_wrapper.sh command, then the automated Firebot build process
   will begin and will create directories and check out repositories as needed.

=========================
= Firebot files/scripts =
=========================

# firebot_linux_wrapper.sh or firebot_mac_wrapper.sh

    The _wrapper script uses a semaphore file that ensures multiple instances of Firebot do not run, which would cause file conflicts.
    This script should be called from crontab to start firebot.

# firebot_linux.sh

    This is the primary Firebot automated test script used on Linux with a queueing system (e.g., TORQUE).
    This script is invoked via crontab (details below).
    By default, Firebot is run in verification mode, but the -v option can be used to run Firebot in validation mode.
    Note: In validation mode, the file /FDS-SMV/Validation/Process_All_Output.sh is used to obtain a list of
    active (uncommended) validation cases.

# firebot_mac.sh

    This is the primary Firebot automated test script used on Mac OS X.
    This script is invoked via crontab (details below).

# firebot_website.py:

    This Python script generates an html file showing the status of recent Firebot test/build cycles.
    This script writes out an html file that can be 'cat' to /var/www/html/firebot/index.html.
    This script is invoked via crontab (details below).

# firebot_wiki_publish.sh:

    This bash shell script checks the Firebot build status wiki page (output by firebot_wiki.py) for changes.
    If changes to the build status wiki page are detected (compared to the SVN copy),
    Then Firebot commits the new status page to the SVN repository under fds.firebot@gmail.com.
    This requires a checkout of the wiki pages to exist in /home/firebot/fds_wiki via this command:
    svn checkout https://fds-smv.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/ /home/firebot/fds_wiki --username fds.firebot
    If you are doing this for the first time, be sure to manually send a test commit to the repo so that the username/password gets stored.
    This script is invoked via crontab (details below).

# firebot_wiki.py

    This Python script generates a Google Code wiki markup file showing the status of recent Firebot test/build cycles.
    This script writes out a plaintext .wiki file that can be 'cat' to /home/firebot/firebot/wiki_output/Firebot_Build_Status.wiki
    This script is invoked via crontab (details below).
