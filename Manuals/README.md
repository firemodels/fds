# FDS Manuals

All of the FDS manuals are contained within the sub-folders above. Each sub-folder contains a bash script called `make_guide.sh` that will run PDF-LaTeX and BibTeX enough times to completely compile the guide and update the references. Sub-sub-folders contain both `FIGURES` and `SCRIPT_FIGURES`, the latter being figures that are generated by scripts and not committed to the repository.
