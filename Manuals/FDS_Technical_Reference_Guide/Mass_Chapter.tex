\chapter{Mass, Species and Enthalpy Transport}

This chapter describes in detail the equation of state in the low Mach number limit, the finite difference approximation of the mass and species conservation equations, and the role of the flow divergence as a surrogate for the enthalpy transport equation.
Due to the use of the low Mach number approximation, the energy conservation equation is not solved explicitly but rather is defined implicitly via the divergence of the flow field, which contains the combustion and radiation source terms.


\section{The Equation of State}

A distinguishing feature of a CFD model is the regime of
flow speeds (relative to the speed of sound) for which it is designed. High
speed flow codes involve compressibility effects and shock waves. Low speed
solvers, however, explicitly eliminate compressibility effects that give rise
to acoustic (sound) waves. The Navier-Stokes equations describe the
propagation of information at speeds comparable to that of the fluid flow (for fire, approximately 10~m/s),
but also at speeds comparable to that of sound waves (for still air,
300~m/s). Solving a discretized form of these equations would require extremely small
time steps in order to account for information traveling at the speed of sound, making
practical simulations difficult.

Following the work of Rehm and Baum~\cite{Rehm:1}, an approximation to the equation of state is made by decomposing the pressure
into a ``background'' component and a perturbation. It is assumed that
the background component of pressure can differ from compartment to compartment. If
a volume within the computational domain is isolated from other volumes, except via leak paths or ventilation ducts, it is referred to as a ``pressure zone'' and assigned its own background pressure. The pressure within the $m$th zone, for example, is a linear combination
of its background component and the flow-induced perturbation:
\be p(\bx,t) = \bp_m(z,t) + \tp(\bx,t) \ee
Note that the background pressure is a function of $z$, the vertical spatial coordinate, and time. For most
compartment fire applications, $\bp_m$ changes very little with height or time. However, for situations where the pressure
increases due to a fire in a tightly sealed enclosure, or when the height of the domain is significant, $\bp_m$ takes these effects into
account~\cite{Baum:5}. The ambient pressure field is denoted $\bp_0(z)$. Note that the subscript 0 denotes the exterior of the computational domain, not
time 0. This is the assumed atmospheric pressure stratification that serves as both
the initial and boundary condition for the governing equations.

The purpose of decomposing the pressure is that for low-Mach number flows, it can be assumed that the temperature and density are inversely
proportional, and thus the equation of state (in the $m$th pressure zone) can be approximated
\be \bp_m  =  \rho T \R \sum_\alpha \frac{Z_\alpha}{W_\alpha} = \frac{\rho T \R}{ \bW }  \label{state} \ee
The pressure, $p$, in the state and energy equations is replaced by the background pressure $\bp_m$ to filter out sound waves
that travel at speeds that are much faster
than typical flow speeds expected in fire applications. The low Mach number assumption serves two purposes. First, the filtering of acoustic waves
means that the time step in the numerical algorithm is bound only by the flow speed as opposed to the speed of sound, and second, the modified state
equation leads to a reduction in the number of dependent variables in the system of equations by one. The energy equation (\ref{energy}) is never
explicitly solved, but its source terms are included in the expression for the flow divergence, to be discussed later in the chapter.

The stratification of the atmosphere is derived from the relation
\be \frac{d \bp_0}{dz} = - \rho_0(z) \, g  \ee
where $\rho_0$ is the background density and $g=9.8$ m/s$^2$. Using Eq.~(\ref{state}), the background pressure can be written as a function of the background temperature, $T_0(z)$,
\be \bp_0(z) = p_\infty \; \exp \, \left( -\int^z_{z_\infty} \frac{\bW \, g}{\R \, T_0(z')} dz' \right)  \label{pstrat} \ee
where the subscript infinity generally refers to the ground. A linear temperature stratification of the atmosphere may be
specified by the user such that $T_0(z) = T_\infty + \Gamma z$ where $T_\infty$ is the temperature at the ground and
$\Gamma$ is the lapse rate (e.g., $\Gamma = -0.0098$~K/m is the {\em adiabatic lapse rate}).
In this case $\bp_0$ and $\rho_0$ are derived from Eqs.~(\ref{pstrat}) and (\ref{state}), respectively.
It can then be shown that for $\Gamma \ne 0$ the pressure stratification becomes
\be
   \bp_0(z) = p_\infty  \left( \frac{T_0(z)}{T_\infty} \right)^{\overline{W}g/\R \Gamma}
   \label{pstrat2}
\ee

\section{Mass and Species Transport}

The density and species transport equations are solved using the same basic predictor-corrector scheme.
Advection terms are written in ``flux divergence'' form. In the predictor step, the density in cell $ijk$ at time level $(n+1)$ is estimated based on information at the $n$th level
\be  \frac{\rho_{ijk}^{*}-\rho_{ijk}^n}{\dt}
    + \nabla\!\cdot(\overline{\rho}^{FL} \mathbf{u})_{ijk}^n = 0
\ee
The quantity $\overline{\rho}^{FL}$ indicates a \emph{flux limiter} applied to the cell face value, as discussed below in Section \ref{sec_flux_limiters}.

Following the prediction of the velocity and background pressure at time level $(n+1)$, the density is corrected via
\be \frac{\rho_{ijk}^{n+1}-\ha\left(\rho_{ijk}^n
     +\rho_{ijk}^{*}\right)} {\ha \dt}
    + \nabla\!\cdot(\overline{\rho}^{FL} \mathbf{u})_{ijk}^{*}
    = 0 \ee
The species conservation equations are differenced the same way, with the addition of the diffusion term (including turbulent diffusion):
\be  \frac{(\rho Z_\alpha)_{ijk}^{*}-(\rho Z_\alpha)_{ijk}^n}{\dt}
  + \nabla\!\cdot(\overline{\rho Z_\alpha}^{FL} \mathbf{u})_{ijk}^n
  = \nabla\!\cdot (\rho D_\alpha \nabla Z_\alpha)_{ijk}^n \ee
at the predictor step, and
\be \frac{(\rho Z_\alpha)_{ijk}^{n+1}-\ha\left((\rho Z_\alpha)_{ijk}^n
     +(\rho Z_\alpha)_{ijk}^{*}\right)} {\ha \dt}
    + \nabla\!\cdot(\overline{\rho Z_\alpha}^{FL} \mathbf{u})_{ijk}^*
    = \nabla\!\cdot (\rho D_\alpha \nabla Z_\alpha)_{ijk}^{*} \ee
at the corrector step.

Mass source terms due to chemistry, evaporation, or pyrolysis are time split and applied after the corrector step (see Section \ref{sec_time_splitting}).


\subsection{Flux Limiters}
\label{sec_flux_limiters}

A \emph{flux limiter} is a form of interpolation scheme which depends on the local state of the flow field and scalar data. Simple linear interpolation of the cell-centered scalar data to the cell face would result in a central differencing scheme.  Such purely centered schemes are known to generate intolerable levels of dispersion error (spurious wiggles) leading to unphysical results such as negative densities or mass fractions outside the range of [0,1].  To address this issue, FDS has relied on a \emph{flux correction} scheme (see Appendix \ref{app_boundedness}) which adds a sufficient amount of numerical diffusion to maintain boundedness.  There is, however, more to the problem.

For uniform flow velocity, a fundamental property of the exact solution to the equations governing scalar transport is that the total variation of the scalar field (the sum of the absolute values of the scalar differences between neighboring cells) is preserved or diminished (never increased).  In other words, no new extrema are created.  Numerical schemes which preserve this property are referred to as total variation diminishing (TVD) schemes.  The practical importance of using a TVD scheme for fire modelling is that such a scheme is able to accurately track coherent vortex structure in turbulent flames and does not develop spurious reaction zones.

FDS employs two popular second-order TVD schemes as options for scalar transport: Superbee and CHARM.  Superbee \cite{Roe:1986} is recommended for LES because it more accurately preserves the scalar variance for coarse grid solutions which are not expected to be smooth.  Due to the gradient steepening applied in Superbee, however, the convergence degrades at small grid spacing for smooth solutions (the method will revert to a stair-step pattern instead of the exact solution).  CHARM \cite{Zhou:1995}, though slightly more dissipative than Superbee, is convergent, and is therefore the better choice for DNS calculations where the flame front is well resolved.

When a flux limiter is chosen for scalar transport, FDS formulates the density and species advection terms in ``flux divergence'' form.  For example, the predictor step of the continuity equation is discretized as
\be  \frac{\rho_{ijk}^* - \rho_{ijk}^n}{\dt}
    + \nabla\!\cdot(\overline{\rho}^{FL} \mathbf{u})_{ijk}^n = 0
\ee
In 1D, we would have
\be  \frac{\rho_{i}^* - \rho_{i}^n}{\dt}
    + \frac{\overline{\rho}^{FL}_{i+\frac{1}{2}} u_{i+\frac{1}{2}} - \overline{\rho}^{FL}_{i-\frac{1}{2}} u_{i-\frac{1}{2}}}{\dx} = 0
\ee
Note that the $\ha$ index indicates a face value for a particular cell ($i,j,k$). A flux-limited scalar value (density in this case) premultiplies the staggered, face-centered velocity to form the scalar advective flux.

Consider face $i+\frac{1}{2}$ between cells $i$ and $i+1$ and let $\phi$ denote a general scalar variable.  The local ($loc$) and upstream ($up$) data variations are
\begin{eqnarray}
\delta \phi_{loc} &=& \phi_{i+1}-\phi_i \nonumber\\
\delta \phi_{up}  &=& \left\{ \begin{array}{ll} \phi_i-\phi_{i-1} & \mbox{if} \quad u_i>0 \\ \phi_{i+2}-\phi_{i+1} & \mbox{if} \quad u_i<0 \end{array} \right. \nonumber
\end{eqnarray}
The limiter function $B(r)$ depends on the upstream-to-local data ratio, $r=\delta \phi_{up}/\delta \phi_{loc}$ \cite{Toro}.  In FDS, options for this function are:

\begin{description}
\item[Central Differencing]
\begin{equation} B(r) = 1 \end{equation}
\item[First-order Upwinding (Godunov's Scheme)]
\begin{equation} B(r) = 0 \end{equation}
\item[Superbee] (default for LES mode)
\begin{equation} B(r) = \max(0,\min(2r,1),\min(r,2)) \end{equation}
\item[MINMOD]
\begin{equation} B(r) = \max(0,\min(1,r)) \end{equation}
Once $B(r)$ has been determined, the scalar face value is found from
\begin{equation}
\label{eqn_flux_limiter}
\overline{\phi}^{FL}_{i+1/2} = \left\{ \begin{array}{lcll} \phi_i &+& B(r) \,\frac{1}{2}(\phi_{i+1}-\phi_i) & \mbox{if} \quad u_i>0 \vspace{0.2 cm}\\
\phi_{i+1} &+& B(r) \,\frac{1}{2}(\phi_i-\phi_{i+1}) & \mbox{if} \quad u_i<0 \end{array} \right.
\end{equation}
\item[CHARM] (default for DNS mode)
\begin{equation} B(r) = \frac{r(3r+1)}{(r+1)^2} \end{equation}
For this limiter~\cite{Zhou:1995,Kempf:2003}, the FDS implementation uses the reciprocal definition of the data ratio, $r = \delta C_{loc}/\delta C_{up}$.  The limiter function is given by and the scalar face value is then determined from
\begin{equation}
\label{eqn_charm_limiter}
\overline{\phi}^{FL}_{i+1/2} = \left\{ \begin{array}{lcll} \phi_i &+& B(r) \,\frac{1}{2}(\phi_i-\phi_{i-1}) & \mbox{if} \quad u_i>0 \vspace{0.2 cm}\\
\phi_{i+1} &+& B(r) \,\frac{1}{2}(\phi_{i+1}-\phi_{i+2}) & \mbox{if} \quad u_i<0 \end{array} \right.
\end{equation}
\item[Monotonicity-Preserving 5th-Order (MP5)]
The MP5 scheme of Suresh and Huynh \cite{Suresh:1997} is based on the keen observation that three points cannot distinguish between extrema and discontinuities.  The functional form of the limiter is not a simple as the three-point schemes described above, so we refer the reader to the original paper or the FDS source code for details.  But the basic idea behind the method is to use a five-point stencil, three upwind and two downwind, to reconstruct the cell face value, considering both accuracy and monotonicity-preserving constraints.  An additional benefit of the MP5 scheme is that it was designed specifically with strong stability-preserving (SSP) Runge-Kutta time discretizations in mind.  The predictor-corrector scheme used by FDS is similar to the second-order SSP scheme described in \cite{Gottlieb:2001}.
\end{description}


\subsubsection{Notes on Implementation}

In practice, we set $r=0$ initially and only compute $r$ if the denominator is not zero.  Note that for $\delta \phi_{loc}=0$ it does not matter which limiter (0-3) is used: all the limiters yield the same scalar face value.  For CHARM, we set both $r=0$ and $B=0$ initially and only compute $B$ if $r>0$ (this requires data variations to have the same sign), else CHARM reduces to Godunov's scheme.

Central differencing, Godunov's scheme, and MINMOD are essentially included for completeness, debugging, and educational purposes.  These schemes have little utility in practice.

\subsection{Time Splitting for Mass Source Terms}
\label{sec_time_splitting}

Following the corrector step of the transport scheme, source terms are applied to the scalars.  The source terms are typically related to particle evaporation or combustion, and these processes are computed at the end of the time step. In the case of combustion, the total mass of a grid cell is not changed; rather the species mass fractions change. For particle evaporation, mass is simply added to the cell, particle by particle, and the species mass fractions are adjusted accordingly.
\be
   (\rho Z_\alpha)_{ijk}^{n+1} = (\rho Z_\alpha)_{ijk}^{n+1} + \dt \, \left( \dm_{\alpha}''' + \dm_{b,\alpha}''' \right)_{ijk}
\ee


\subsection{Boundary Conditions for Temperature, Species Mass Fraction, and Density}

The gas temperature, species mass fractions, and density are computed at the center of each grid cell. At an exterior boundary, or at
the boundary of an interior obstruction, these values must be computed at the face of the cell that falls at the boundary interface. In general, the temperature at the boundary, $T_f$, is
computed first, followed by species mass fractions, $Z_{\alpha,f}$, followed by density, $\rho_f$. The density is typically determined from the equation of state:
\be  \rho_f = \frac{\overline{p}_m}{ {\cal R} \, T_f \, \sum_\alpha (Z_{\alpha,f}/W_\alpha) }  \ee 
Here, $\overline{p}_m$ denotes the background pressure of the gas phase region.

When necessary, the boundary value is linearly extrapolated one half
of a grid cell into the ``ghost'' cell for use by the gas phase solver. In the sections below, the value at the center of the gas phase cell
adjacent to the boundary is denoted with the subscript ``g'', and the value at the boundary by ``f'' (for face).

\subsubsection{Solid Boundaries}

At a solid boundary, the surface temperature, $T_f$, is either specified or computed as described in Chapter~\ref{chapter:solid_phase}.
For an LES calculation, the convective heat flux at the surface is determined via an empirical heat transfer coefficient, $h$, and the convective heat flux at the boundary is written:
\be k \frac{T_g - T_f}{\dn/2} = h \; (T_g-T_f)  \label{ebal} \ee
where $\dn/2$ is the distance between the center of the gas cell
and the surface. The convective heat transfer coefficient, $h$, is described in Section~\ref{conflux}. For a DNS calculation, the convective 
heat transfer is determined directly from the computed or specified surface temperature.

There is no transfer of mass at a solid boundary; thus, the boundary value for the species mixture $\alpha$ is simply
\be Z_{\alpha,f} = Z_{\alpha,g} \ee

\subsubsection{Open Boundaries}

The term open denotes a non-solid exterior boundary of the computational domain. Gases are allowed to flow freely in and out. At these boundaries, the temperature and species mass fractions take on their respective exterior values if the flow is incoming, and take on their respective values in the grid cell adjacent to the boundary if the flow is outgoing. This is a simple upwind boundary condition.



\subsubsection{Specified Mass Flux}

Here, the mass flux of species $\alpha$, $\dot{m}_\alpha''$, is specified or computed as part of the overall solid phase calculation.
To determine the value of species mixture $\alpha$ at the boundary, $Z_{\alpha,f}$, the following equation must be solved iteratively
\be \dot{m}_\alpha'' = u_n \rho_s Z_{\alpha,f}
  - \rho D_\alpha \frac{Z_{\alpha,g}-Z_{\alpha,f}}{\dn/2} \ee
where $u_n$ is the normal component of velocity at the wall pointing into
the flow domain, and $\dn/2$ is the distance between the center of the gas
cell and the wall. The reason for the iteration is that the density at the surface, $\rho_f$, is a function of
$Z_{\alpha,f}$.





\subsubsection{Mesh Interface Boundaries}

In simulations involving more than one numerical mesh, information has to be passed between meshes, even when
the meshes are being processed by separate computers. If two meshes abut each other, and the mesh cells are aligned and the same size, then
one mesh simply uses the density and species mass fractions of the adjacent mesh as the ``ghost'' cell values. However, in cases where the
mesh cells are not the same size, the exchange of information must be done more carefully. Consider a case where two meshes meet:

\begin{picture}(200,110)(0,-10)
\setlength{\unitlength}{0.02in}
\put(120,10){\framebox(20,20){ }}
\put(120,30){\framebox(20,20){ }}
\put(140,10){\framebox(40,40){ }}
\put(100,30){\makebox(0,0){Mesh 1}}
\put(200,30){\makebox(0,0){Mesh 2}}
\thicklines
\put(140,0){\line(0,1){60}}
\end{picture}

\noindent
We want the total and species mass fluxes between meshes to be the same, or as close as possible.
Let the density in cell $(1,j',k')$ of Mesh 2 be denoted $\rho_{1,j'k'}^{(2)}$. Assume that this cell abuts four cells in Mesh 1. The densities in the four abutting cells
of Mesh 1 are denoted $\rho_{I,jk}^{(1)}$. Note that $j$ and $k$ are not the same as $j'$ and $k'$. $I$ is the number of cells in the $x$ direction of Mesh 1. The
ghost cell quantities in Mesh 1 have an $i$ index of $I+1$. The ghost cell quantities in Mesh 2 have an $i$ index of 0.
We want to assert mass conservation at the mesh interface:
\be
   \sum_{j,k} u_{I,jk}^{(1)} \; \frac{\rho_{I+1,jk}^{(1)}+\rho_{I,jk}^{(1)}}{2} \; \dy^{(1)} \, \dz^{(1)}  =
              u_{0,j'k'}^{(2)} \; \frac{\rho_{1,j'k'}^{(2)}+\rho_{0,j'k'}^{(2)}}{2} \; \dy^{(2)} \, \dz^{(2)}  \label{rhou}
\ee
When solving for $\rho_{0,j'k'}^{(2)}$, the ghost cell value for Mesh 2, we have to assume that the ghost cells values for Mesh 1 are simply linearly interpolated
from the gas phase values of Mesh 1 and Mesh 2:
\be \rho_{I+1,jk}^{(1)} = \rho_{I,jk}^{(1)} + \frac{2 \, \dx^{(1)}}{\dx^{(1)}+\dx^{(2)}} \left( \rho_{1,j'k'}^{(2)} - \rho_{I,jk}^{(1)} \right)  \label{ghostrho} \ee
Rearranging terms in Eq.~(\ref{rhou}) and using the expression for the ghost cells from Eq.~(\ref{ghostrho}), we get:
\be \rho_{0,j'k'}^{(2)} = -\rho_{1,j'k'}^{(2)} + \frac{1}{u_{0,j'k'}^{(2)} \dy^{(2)} \, \dz^{(2)} } \sum_{j,k}  u_{1,jk}^{(1)} \dy^{(1)} \, \dz^{(1)}
    \left[ 2 \, \rho_{I,jk}^{(1)} +  \frac{2 \, \dx^{(1)}}{\dx^{(1)}+\dx^{(2)}}  \left( \rho_{1,j'k'}^{(2)} - \rho_{I,jk}^{(1)} \right)  \right]  \ee

\section{The Divergence}

Because of the low Mach number assumption, the divergence of the flow, $\nabla\!\cdot \bu$, plays a very important role in the overall solution scheme. The divergence is obtained by taking the material (substantial) derivative
of the modified Equation of State~(\ref{state}), and then substituting terms from the mass
and energy conservation equations. As shown in Appendix \ref{app_divergence}, for the $m$th zone with background pressure $\bp_m$, the divergence may be written as
\begin{equation}
\label{eqn_divfromeos}
\nabla\!\cdot \bu = {\cal D} - {\cal P}\; \dod{\bp_m}{t}
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}
\label{eqn_fdsP1}
\mathcal{P} = \frac{1}{\overline{p}_m}\left( 1 - \frac{\mathcal{R}}{\overline{W} c_p}  \right)
\end{equation}
and
\begin{align}
\label{eqn_fdsD1}
\mathcal{D} &= \frac{\dot{m}_b^\tripleprime}{\rho}\frac{\overline{W}}{\overline{W}_b} +
\frac{\overline{W}}{\rho} \sum_\alpha \Div \left( \rho D_\alpha \nabla[Z_\alpha/W_\alpha] \right) +
\frac{1}{\rho}\sum_\alpha \left( \frac{\overline{W}}{W_\alpha} -
\frac{h_{s,\alpha}}{c_p T} \right) \dot{m}_{\alpha}^\tripleprime  + \mathcal{P} w \rho g \nonumber  \\
&+ \frac{\mathcal{R}}{\overline{W} c_p \overline{p}_m} \left[ \dot{q}^\tripleprime - \dq_b''' -
\Div \dot{\mathbf{q}}^{\prime\prime} - \sum_\alpha h_{s,\alpha} \Div \rho D_\alpha \nabla Z_\alpha +
\dot{m}_{b}^{\tripleprime} \sum_\alpha Z_{b,\alpha} c_{p,\alpha}(T_b-T)  \right]
\end{align}
Contributions to the divergence of the flow include the heat release rate of the fire, $\dq'''$, heat losses to evaporating droplets,
$\dq_b'''$, the net heat flux from thermal conduction and radiation, $\nabla\!\cdot \dbq''$, updrafts of air over considerable heights of
the atmosphere, the net mass flux from gas species diffusion and production, and global pressure changes. The change in the background
pressure with time, $\partial \bp_m/\partial t$, is non-zero only if
it assumed that the compartment is tightly sealed, in which case the background pressure, $\bp_m$, can no longer be assumed constant due to
the increase (or decrease) in mass and thermal energy within the enclosure. The time derivative of the background pressure of the $m$th
pressure zone, $\Omega_m$, is found by integrating Eq.~(\ref{eqn_divfromeos}) over the zone volume:
\begin{equation}
\dod{\bp_m}{t} = \left( \int_{\Omega_m} {\cal D} \, dV - \int_{\partial \Omega_m} \bu \cdot d\bS \right) \Big/ \int_{\Omega_m} {\cal P} \, dV  \label{concon}
\end{equation}
Equation~(\ref{concon}) is essentially a consistency condition, ensuring that blowing air or starting a fire within a sealed
compartment leads to an appropriate decrease in the divergence within the volume.


\subsection{Discretizing the Divergence}
\label{div_discret}

The thermal and material diffusion terms of Eq.~(\ref{eqn_divfromeos}) are pure second-order central differences,
with no upwind or downwind bias; thus, they are differenced the same
way in both the predictor and corrector steps. For example, the thermal
conduction term is differenced as follows:
\begin{eqnarray}
(\nabla\!\cdot k \nabla T)_{ijk} &=&
              \frac{1}{\dx}
         \left[k_{i+\ha,jk}\frac{T_{i+1,jk}-T_{ijk}}{\dx}
              -k_{i-\ha,jk}\frac{T_{ijk}-T_{i-1,jk}}{\dx}\right]+  \nonumber \\
            &&\frac{1}{\dy}
         \left[k_{i,j+\ha,k}\frac{T_{i,j+1,k}-T_{ijk}}{\dy}
              -k_{i,j-\ha,k}\frac{T_{ijk}-T_{i,j-1,k}}{\dy}\right]+ \nonumber \\
            &&\frac{1}{\dz}
         \left[k_{ij,k+\ha}\frac{T_{ij,k+1}-T_{ijk}}{\dz}
              -k_{ij,k-\ha}\frac{T_{ijk}-T_{ij,k-1}}{\dz}\right]
\end{eqnarray}
The thermal conductivity at the cell interface, denoted by the $\ha$ cell index, is the average of its values in the two adjacent cells.
The gas temperature, $T$, is derived from the density and species mass fractions via the equation of state:
\be T_{ijk} = \frac{\bp_m}{\rho_{ijk} {\cal R}\, \sum_{\alpha=0}^{N_s} (Z_{\alpha,ijk}/W_\alpha)}\ee
Because only species 1 through $N_s$ are explicitly computed
\be Z_{0,ijk} =  1 -  \sum_{\alpha=1}^{N_s} Z_{\alpha,ijk} \ee
The molecular weight, $\bW_\alpha$, of the lumped species $Z_\alpha$ is computed as
\be \bW_\alpha =  \sum_{n=0}^{N_s} \frac{Y_n}{W_n} \ee
where $Y_n$ is the mass fraction of species $n$ in the lumped species $Z_\alpha$.


\subsubsection{Computing the Background Pressure Rise}

To describe how the background pressure of the $m$th pressure zone, $\bp_m$, is updated in time, consider the expression for the
divergence written in compact notation:
\begin{equation}
\label{eqn_divfromeos2}
\nabla\!\cdot \bu = {\cal D} - {\cal P}\; \dod{\bp_m}{t}
\end{equation}
The terms $\mathcal{D}$ and $\mathcal{P}$ are defined by Eqs.~(\ref{eqn_fdsD1}) and (\ref{eqn_fdsP1}), respectively. The subscript $m$ refers to the
number of the {\em pressure zone}; that is, a volume within the computational domain that is allowed to have its own background pressure rise. A closed room
within a building, for example, is a pressure zone.
The time derivative of the background pressure of the $m$th
pressure zone is found by integrating Eq.~(\ref{eqn_divfromeos2}) over the zone volume (denoted by $\Omega_m$):
\begin{equation}
\dod{\bp_m}{t} = \left( \int_{\Omega_m} {\cal D} \, dV - \int_{\partial \Omega_m} \bu \cdot d\bS \right) \Big/ \int_{\Omega_m} {\cal P} \, dV  \label{concon2}
\end{equation}
Equation~(\ref{concon2}) is essentially a consistency condition, ensuring that blowing air or starting a fire within a sealed
compartment leads to an appropriate decrease in the divergence within the volume.

The sensible enthalpy is a function of the temperature:
\be
  h_s = \sum_\alpha Z_\alpha h_{s,\alpha} \quad;\quad  h_{s,\alpha}=\sum_n Y_n h_{s,n}  \quad; \quad h_{s,n}(T)=\int_{T_0}^T c_{p,n}(T') \,\mbox{d}T'
\ee
The values for $h_{s,n}$ and $c_{p,n}$ are obtained by table lookup from the NIST-JANAF tables~\cite{NIST_JANAF}.
The values are taken to the nearest degree Kelvin.


\subsubsection{Combining Pressure Zones}

In the event that a barrier separating two pressure zones should rupture, Eq.~(\ref{concon2}) is modified so that the pressure in the
newly connected zones is driven towards an equilibrium pressure:
\be
  \bp_{eq} = \sum_m \left( \bp_m \int_{\Omega_m} {\cal P} \, dV  \right)  \Big/  \sum_m \int_{\Omega_m} {\cal P} \, dV \approx \frac{ \sum_m V_m }{ \sum_m (V_m/\bp_m) }
\ee
Note that
\be
  \int_{\Omega_m} {\cal P} \, dV \approx  \frac{ V_m}{\gamma \bp_m }
\ee
To drive the pressure within the connected zones towards each other, a volume flow, $\dot{V}_m^*$, is applied to each zone. This flow is intended to move gas
from zones with the higher pressures towards zones with lower pressures. Eq.~(\ref{concon2}) now becomes:
\be
   \dod{\bp_{eq}}{t} - \frac{ \bp_m - \bp_{eq} }{\tau} =
   \left( \int_{\Omega_m} {\cal D} \, dV - \int_{\partial \Omega_m} \bu \cdot d\bS - \dot{V}_m^* \right) \Big/ \int_{\Omega_m} {\cal P} \, dV
\ee
This equation is solved for $\dot{V}_m^*$.
The first term on the left is the change in the equilibrium pressure with time:
\be \dod{\bp_{eq}}{t} = \left( \sum_m \int_{\Omega_m} {\cal D} \, dV - \sum_m \int_{\partial \Omega_m} \bu \cdot d\bS \right) \Big/ \sum_m \int_{\Omega_m} {\cal P} \, dV \ee
The summation is over all connected zones, and it is essentially the net change in pressure with time for the entire connected region. If there is any opening to the
exterior of the computational domain, this term is set to zero and all connected zone pressures are driven towards ambient.
The second term on the left forces the pressure in the $m$th pressure zone towards the equilibrium.
The constant, $\tau$, is a characteristic time for the pressure to come into equilibrium. Its default value is on the order of 1~s. In reality, room pressures typically
come into equilibrium very rapidly, but air movements associated with rapid changes in pressure can cause numerical instabilities. Because of the low Mach number assumption,
FDS should not be used for rapid discharge of pressure vessels.
