Burner in Smokeview should be purple.
At end of simulation take the soot density for sp1 and interpolate to get soot density at end time - 0.2 s.  
Do same for sp2 and sp3 using their delay.  
Compute flowrate weighted average and convert to kg/m^2.  
Using default value of extinction coefficient, percent obscuration of asp1 should be 17.97 % at T_END.
