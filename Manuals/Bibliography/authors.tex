{
\item[Jason Floyd] is a Senior Engineer at Hughes Associates, Inc., in Baltimore, Maryland. He received a bachelors of science and Ph.D. in the Nuclear Engineering Program of the University of Maryland. After graduating, he won a National Research Council Post-Doctoral Fellowship at the Building and Fire Research Laboratory of NIST, where he developed the combustion algorithm within FDS. He is currently funded by NIST under grant 70NANB8H8161 from the Fire Research Grants Program (15 USC 278f). He is a principal developer of the combustion model and control logic within FDS.
