\chapter{Introduction}
The most effective method for learning how to fight fire is to fight fire.  This however is expensive and particularly dangerous for the trainee.   In particular, some fire situations that must be trained for are too large and dangerous to re-create in a training setting involving real fires.  Environmental concerns are limiting the amount and kind of live fire training available in many areas of the country.  Methods are then needed to allow fire fighters to gain valuable experience using virtual reality techniques already applied in other fields so that they may learn without the possibility of harming themselves or others.  It is a challenge to simulate fire fighter training scenarios that are accurate and to present them in a form that are realistic and practical due to the large amounts of computational resources required.   Presently, fire fighter trainers either concentrate on incident command issues or depend on an {\em expert}\ to alter the fire.  The trainer developed here will be Physics based so that the fire and smoke visualized will be closer to what one would expect to find when fighting real fires.

Presently, fire fighters train in the classroom and in live fire training using real fires in real facilities.  Visual based training presently relies on experts to run the fire and are not physics based.  This project will continue to develop a computer based fire fighting training tool to improve training opportunities while lowering the cost and risk of death and injury.   Two methods are being used to create a training tool.   The first and simpler method  is to use FDS and Smokeview to create animations of fire scenarios.  These animations will be viewable in a standard DVD player.  The DVD menus will be used to walk a fire fighter through a series of decisions.  The second method will be more interactive.  Using Smokeview, the trainee will {\em walk}\ through an FDS generated fire scene observing and making decisions.  Several  scenarios will be simulated with FDS.  These scenarios involve cases where experimental data is available; the Maryland Fire Research Institute's (MFRI) training tower and the Montgomery County's flashover trainer.  In subsequent years, more generic scenarios will be modeled; a ranch house (one level) and a townhouse (multi-level).

NIST is uniquely positioned to apply research to this problem that it developed for modeling fire and smoke movement.  The fire science software tools, FDS and Smokeview will be used as a basis for developing a virtual reality based fire fighting training tool.  As a fire simulation unfolds a series of natural break point will be encountered where the trainee will be asked questions such as: Should the window be opened?  Should the door be closed? Should the hose stream be opened?  The simulation will continue based on the answers provided.  These questions will be designed to teach the trainee about tactics relevant to fire fighting such as the effect ventilation on fire spread.    Since FDS cannot yet perform calculations in real time, simulations will be pre-computed for all possible question outcomes.  Smokeview will be enhanced to be able to {\em jump}
from one scenario to another according to the trainee's responses.

\section{Numerical Fire Fighting Training Tools}
Two software tools are used to generate the Physics based fire fighter training scenarios documented in this report.  The Fire Dynamics Simulator is used to perform the fire modeling simulations and Smokeview is used to visualize the simulations.

\subsection{Fire Dynamics Simulator}
The Fire Dynamics Simulator (FDS) is used to perform numerical simulations using established Physics based algorithms. It is a computational fluid dynamics or CFD model of fire-driven fluid flow. FDS predicts smoke and/or hot air flow movement caused by fire, wind, ventilation systems and other factors by solving numerically the fundamental equations governing fluid flow, commonly known as the Navier-Stokes equations. FDS solves a form of these equations appropriate for low-speed, thermally-driven flow with an emphasis on smoke and heat transport from fires. These approximations allow the computations to be performed both accurately and efficiently. Version 1 was released in 2000. The predictions performed here were made with Version 5 released in 2008.

FDS like any CFD model requires that the room or building of interest be divided into small rectangular control volumes called computational cells. The model then computes the density, velocity, temperature, pressure and species concentration of the gas in each cell based on the conservation laws of mass, momentum, and energy.  Radiative heat transfer is included in the model via the solution of the radiation transport equation for a non-scattering gray gas. All solid surfaces are assigned thermal boundary conditions, plus information about their burning behavior. Heat and mass transfer to and from solid surfaces is usually handled with empirical correlations. FDS utilizes material properties of the furnishings, walls, floors, and ceilings to compute fire growth and spread.

FDS also uses material properties of the furnishings, wall, floors, and ceilings to simulate fire spread.  The spatial resolution of the simulation depends on the number of cells used to discretize the case, much like the quality of a digital photograph depends mainly on the number of pixels. The number of cells is ultimately limited by the computing power available. Current PCs limit the number of cells to a few million. Users of the model must decide how much detail they want to incorporate. Special attention is paid to how much computing is required to produce an acceptable answer. In general, finer grids result in longer calculations which produce better results. Ultimately one reaches a point of diminishing returns where the answer becomes insensitive to the increasing resolution of the grid.  The temporal resolution or time step size is determined from the grid resolution and the flow speed. The time step is chosen by FDS so that flow does not cross more than one grid cell during one time step.

The fire itself is a source term in the governing equations, creating buoyant motion that drives the smoke and hot gases throughout the room. The chemistry of the combustion process is complicated by the fact that the fuel for the fire may include room furnishings, ceiling materials, wall and floor coverings, i.e. a wide assortment of different materials. FDS makes simplifications about the combustion, essentially saying that fuel and oxygen burn readily when mixed. The rate at which energy is generated is obtained from experiments. There is no attempt to model the fundamental chemistry which can involve hundreds of chemical reactions.  A complete description of the FDS model as well as the technical references which support the model are given in references \cite{FDS_Tech_Guide_5,FDS_Users_Guide_5}.

Inputs required by FDS include the geometry of the structure, the computational cell size, the location of the ignition source, the energy release rate of the ignition source, thermal properties of walls, ceilings, floors, furnishings, and the size, location, and timing of door and window openings to the outside which critically influence fire growth and spread.  More specific input assumptions are given later in the sections documenting the various training cases.



\subsection{Smokeview}
Powerful techniques are needed for interpreting the massive amounts of simulation data generated by the fire model, FDS.  Smokeview is a scientific visualization program that was developed to display the results of an FDS model computation. Smokeview {\em translates}\ data simulated by FDS into various types of moving or animated images.  These images range in complexity from simple tracer particles, to 2D shaded contours, 3D level surfaces and finally realistic looking smoke and fire.  The realistic smoke visualizations use algorithms known as Beer's law to associate computed soot density with optical opacity.  These visualization algorithms are Physics based, they create images based upon the on numerical results generated by the fire model FDS.  A complete description of the Smokeview visualization program as well as a description of the algorithms used to perform the visualizations are given in the references~\cite{Smokeview_Users_Guide_5,Smokeview_Tech_Guide_5}.

\section{Fire Modeling Input Parameters}

\subsection{Geometry}
FDS approximates the governing equations on a rectilinear grid. This three-dimensional grid represents the volume modeled by FDS. The grid is isolated from the surroundings, that is, all the smoke and heat generated by the fire stays within the grid and the air does not enter the grid. The user may, however, prescribe vents that allow smoke and heat to leave and air to enter the grid area. The user prescribes rectangular obstructions that are forced to conform to the underlying grid. Multi-blocking is a term used to describe the use of more than one rectangular grid or mesh in a calculation.

FDS predictions are sensitive to grid size; using a larger number of smaller cells will generally capture more features of the flow; however, the computation time increases more than linearly with the increase in number of grid cells. Computation times of one day on a fast computer are not uncommon but may increase to several months with a large number of grid cells. Therefore, it is important to use the smallest number of grid cells that still capture the important features of the fire. One way to reduce the number of grid cells is the use of multi-blocking. With multi-blocking, smaller grid cells that capture more detail are used near the fire and larger grid cells with less detail are used remote from the fire.

Building items such as walls, floors, windows, doors and furniture are described in FDS as rectilinear blocks. These blocks must have sides that are either horizontal or vertical and no sloped or curved surfaces are allowed. The blocks may be colored for identification and may be assigned material properties. The blocks may be entered into the simulation with exact measurements from the building. However FDS can only work with items that fall exactly on grid cell boundaries. FDS takes the input blocks and adjusts them to match the grid cell boundaries. As a result, items may either grow or shrink to match the grid. In most cases this does not have a major impact on the calculations, although it can result in walls with no thickness or walls with gaps at intersections. Usually these issues are resolved by adjusting the size of the blocks slightly to produce the desired geometry that matches the grid size.

\subsection{Fire}

\subsection{Ventilation}
Vents in FDS are openings from the model to ambient conditions outside the computational domain. Vents allow smoke and heat to leave the grid area and air to enter. Vents may be either simple openings that allow natural flow to occur based on the buoyancy of the hot gases, or vents may use a specified or forced flow rate such as the flow from a fan. Vents can also be used to introduce heat into the modeling domain. In both the mock-up and the incident simulations, vents are used to represent the areas of the foam which were initially ignited.

\subsubsection{Openings Within the Grid}
The placement of blocks within the grid forms the structure of the building and its contents. The hydrodynamic calculations performed by FDS allow air, hot gases, smoke and flames to flow through the simulated building. Thermal radiation travels by line-of-sight and may be intercepted by obstacles within the grid.

Normal buildings may appear tightly constructed, but there are many small openings or leaks within a building that allow for the flow of air or combustion products. Since objects can only exist at grid boundaries, small leaks may be created by either using a very small grid size, or by representing many small leaks by fewer large leaks.

During the course of a fire, some items within the building may be consumed by the fire or otherwise change position. FDS does not have the capability to calculate burn-through or collapse but the user can remove items during the course of the calculations. Items that are removed can represent objects that fall or are destroyed by fire, or objects that are changed by people such as doors or windows that are opened.


\subsection{Materials}
When a wall, ceiling, floor, piece of furniture, or any other material is defined for use in the FDS model, it is given a set of physical and thermal properties that are used by the model. Some of these properties such as thermal diffusivity, thermal conductivity, density and thickness impact the heat transfer in the material. For materials that burn, additional parameters such as ignition temperature, heat of combustion, heat of vaporization and maximum burning rate are specified. The properties for the materials, to the extent they were available, were taken from standard references or fire experiments.

The combustion process is handled in two ways within FDS. In one version, the fuel gasification rate is related to the radiant heat flux imposed from the fire onto the material. The mass burning rates of these same materials are measured in a cone calorimeter (or similar) apparatus; hence, the importance of collecting these data as described in Chapter 4. An alternative way to handle the gasification of fuel in FDS is to base the fuel generation rate on a measured heat of vaporization and ignition temperature. Both versions utilize a mixture fraction combustion model, in which burning occurs in regions where the fuel and air are in stoichiometric proportion. The second approach was used in FDS to model both the mock-up experiments and the full nightclub fire.

The accuracy of either of these combustion models is related to the complexity of the fuel and the resolution of the numerical grid used during the simulation. A maximum burning rate is imposed to limit the amount of pyrolysis that can occur regardless of the amount of heat flux impinging on the surface of the fuel. To the extent that the heat release rates measured for the polyurethane foams by NIST and ATF differed, this had no effect on the calculations presented in this chapter since the same ignition temperature, heat of vaporization, and maximum burning rate were used for simulations of the experimental mock-up and the full nightclub fires.

\section{Overview}
This publication documents a series of FDS test cases used as a basis for fire fighter training. These test cases fall into two logical groups, those that are based on a full scale experiments and those that are meant to be demonstrations of fire phenomena encountered by fire fighters.

The FDS scenarios that are experimentally based are documented by 1) briefly describing the experiment with references to a more complete description, 2) briefly describing the numerical modeling that was performed giving the relevant input files and 3) giving a comparison of some of the experimental data collected with the corresponding numerical results.
