\chapter{Preface}

This document
provides the theoretical basis for the Fire Dynamics Simulator (FDS), following the general framework set forth in
the ``Standard Guide for
Evaluating the Predictive Capability of Deterministic Fire Models,'' ASTM~E~1355~\cite{ASTM:E1355}.
It is the first of a four volume set of companion documents, referred to
collectively as the FDS Technical Reference Guide~\cite{FDS_Tech_Guide}. Volumes 2, 3 and 4 describe the model
verification, experimental validation, and configuration management, respectively.

A separate document, {\em Fire Dynamics Simulator, User's Guide}~\cite{FDS_Users_Guide} describes how the FDS software is
actually used.


\chapter{Disclaimer}

The US Department of Commerce makes no warranty, expressed or implied,
to users of the Fire Dynamics Simulator (FDS), and accepts no responsibility for its use.
Users of FDS assume sole responsibility under Federal law for determining
the appropriateness of its use in any particular application;
for any conclusions drawn from the results of its use; and for any
actions taken or not taken as a result of analysis performed using these tools.

Users are warned that FDS is intended for use only by those competent
in the fields of fluid dynamics, thermodynamics, heat transfer, combustion, and fire science,
and is intended only to supplement the informed judgment of the qualified user.
The software package is a computer model that may or may not have predictive
capability when applied to a specific set of factual circumstances.
Lack of accurate predictions by the model could lead to erroneous
conclusions with regard to fire safety. All results should be evaluated by an informed user.

Throughout this document, the mention of computer hardware or commercial
software does not constitute endorsement by NIST, nor does it indicate that
the products are necessarily those best suited for the intended purpose.


\chapter{Acknowledgments}

\label{acksection}

The development and maintenance of the Fire Dynamics Simulator has been made possible through
a partnership of public and private organizations, both in the United States and abroad. Following
is a list of contributors from the various sectors of the fire research, fire protection engineering and
fire services communities:

FDS is supported financially via internal funding at both NIST and
VTT, Finland. In addition, support is provided by other agencies of
the US Federal Government:
\begin{itemize}
\item The US Nuclear Regulatory Commission Office of Research has funded key
validation experiments, the preparation of the FDS manuals, and the
development of various sub-models that are of importance in the area
of nuclear power plant safety. Special thanks to Mark Salley and Jason
Dreisbach for their efforts and support.  The Office of Nuclear
Material Safety and Safeguards, another branch of the US NRC, has
supported modeling studies of tunnel fires under the direction of
Chris Bajwa and Allen Hansen.
\item The Micro-Gravity Combustion Program of the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration (NASA) has supported several projects that directly or indirectly benefited FDS development.
\item The US Forest Service has supported the development of sub-models in FDS designed to simulate the spread of
fire in the Wildland Urban Interface (WUI). Special thanks to Mark Finney and Tony Bova for their support.
\item The Minerals Management Service of the US Department of the Interior funded research at NIST aimed at
characterizing the burning behavior of oil spilled on the open sea or ice. Part of this research led to the development
of the ALOFT (A Large Outdoor Fire plume Trajectory) model, a forerunner of FDS. Special thanks to Joe Mullin for his
encouragement of the modeling efforts.
\end{itemize}
\noindent At VTT, the FDS development has been supported by
\begin{itemize}
\item The Finnish Funding Agency for Technology and Innovation (TEKES) has supported the development of fire and evacuation simulation capabilities.
\item The Finnish State Nuclear Waste Management Fund (VYR) under the national research programmes on nuclear safety.
\item The European Union through the FP6 and FP7 research projects FIRE PARADOX, TRANSFEU and FIRE-RESIST.
\end{itemize}

The following individuals and organizations played a role in the development of the underlying mathematical model of FDS.
\begin{itemize}
\item Originally, the basic hydrodynamic solver was designed by Ronald Rehm
and Howard Baum with programming help from Darcy Barnett, Dan Lozier
and Hai Tang of the Computing and Applied Mathematics Laboratory
(CAML) at NIST, and Dan Corley of the Building and Fire Research
Laboratory (BFRL). Jim Sims of CAML developed the original
visualization software.  The direct pressure solver was written by
Roland Sweet of the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR),
Boulder, Colorado.
\item Kuldeep Prasad added the multiple-mesh data
structures, paving the way for parallel processing.   Charles Bouldin
devised the basic framework of the parallel version of the code.
\item William Grosshandler and Tom Cleary, both currently at NIST, developed
an enhancement to the smoke detector activation algorithm, originally
conceived by Gunnar Heskestad of Factory Mutual. Steve
Olenick of Combustion Science and Engineering (CSE) implemented the
smoke detector model into FDS.
\item William Grosshandler is also the developer of RadCal, a library of
subroutines that have been incorporated in FDS to provide the
radiative properties of gases and smoke.
\item Professor Fred Mowrer, formerly of the University of Maryland, provided a simple
of model of gas phase extinction to FDS.
\item Chris Lautenburger of the University of California, Berkeley, and Jose Torero and Guillermo Rein of the University of Edinburgh, have
provided valuable insight in the development of the solid phase model.
\end{itemize}
