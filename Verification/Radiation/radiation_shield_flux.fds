Radiation inside a box
======================

This verification case tests the computation of three-dimensional
configuration factor Phi inside a cube box with one hot wall and five
cold (0 K) walls. The exact solutions are calculated at the diagonal
of the cold wall opposite to the hot wall. The exact values are calculated
based on the analytical solution [App. C of Siegel & Howell 1981]

Phi = configuration factor from plane element dA to parallel rectangle H.

Different variations of the case include the grid density
and the number of radiation angles. The input lines for these
modifications are

This simulation is meant to measure the incident heat flux at the bottom
of a box with a radiation shield between the top and bottom of the wall.
