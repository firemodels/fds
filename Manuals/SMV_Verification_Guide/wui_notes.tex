This \chap\ presents visualization techniques added to Smokeview
applicable to WUI (wildland urban interface) and wild fire test
cases. Some of these techniques involve 1) visualizing changing
terrain using satellite images with modeling results overlayed, 2)
visualizing wind sensor data using flow vectors and error
indicators and 3) making use of Smokeview objects for representing
modeling elements such as trees or structures. Smokeview images
are displayed in the following figures to illustrate these
techniques.

Figure \ref{figlevelset} presents images of level set contour
slices drawn on a slope. The thin red line represents where
burning is currently taking place.  The grey region represents
where burning has occurred and the green region represents where
burning has not occurred. Level sets are used to quickly (relative
to a complete computational fluid dynamic calculation ) model fire
spread and fire line locations. In this particular case, images
are drawn at \SI{30}{s}, \SI{60}{s}, \SI{90}{s} and \SI{120}{s}.
The test verifies that the level set slices follow the sloped
terrain. Figure \ref{figterrain2} and \ref{figterrain3} also
present images of level set contours.  These contour slices are
drawn along with a satellite image of the region being modeled.

Figure \ref{figterrain} presents images of temperature contours
drawn on a terrain geometry. The scenario has a small hill
parallel to the vertical axis of the scene. Images are drawn at
\SI{15}{s}, \SI{30}{s}, \SI{45}{s} and \SI{60}{s}. The test
verifies that temperature contours follow the sloped terrain and
that the red blockage (a non-terrain blockage representing a structure) is drawn correctly along
with the terrain.

Smokeview typically visualizes data generated by FDS, CFAST or WFDS.
Figure \ref{figwind} presents a visualization of experimental rather than simulation data generated by a
wind measuring device.  Smokeview can use this data to
visualize wind profiles and variability and uncertainty present in
the experimental data.  The vertical array of green spheres represent
the locations where the wind measurements were recorded. The distance
from these spheres to the green or red spherical shells gives a
relative measure of the wind speed.  The width these shells gives a
measure of the uncertainty in the wind direction measurement.
Likewise the depth (from front to back) of these shells give a
measure of the uncertainty of the wind velocity measurement

Figure \ref{figWUItrees} shows an example of trees drawn as
Smokeview objects.  The tree is drawn as a cylinder colored brown
and a cone colored green.  Tree objects may change appearance as a
simulation progresses as illustrated in Fig. \ref{figWUIstates}.
Tree states are a normal view, partially burned, partially burned (canopy burned away) and completely
burned.

Figure \ref{figWUIparts} shows an example of trees drawn as
particles. Particle represent small units of fuel. Particle color
represents temperature.  As particles use up fuel they disappear.
When many trees are simulated, it is difficult to discern
individual trees when drawn as particles.  Fig. \ref{figWUIiso}
shows an equivalent view using an isosurface. The isosurface location
is determined from the boundary (between particle and non-particle regions in the simulation) of the  particle cloud shown in
Fig. \ref{figWUIparts}.
