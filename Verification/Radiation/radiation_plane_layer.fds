Radiation from a plane layer
============================

This verification case tests the computation of three-dimensional radiation
from a homogenous, infinitelly wide layer of radiating material. 
The temperature of the layer is 1273.15 K and absorption coefficients are
varied. The thickness of the layer is fixed to 1.0 m, and the 
optical depth is 1 * kappa (KAPPA0). Wall temperatures are set to 0 K.


The results are compared against the exact solution presented in [1]

Flux = Sb*[1-2*E_3(tau)]

where Sb is the blackbody radiation flux from an object at the plane 
temperature Sb = 5.67E-8 * T**4 (W/m^2) and E_3(tau) is exponential 
integral function (order 3) of optical depth tau. 

The FDS results are calculated at two mesh discretizations in x-directions
For I=20, both one-band and 6-band versions are included to test the correct 
integration of heat fluxes. For I=20, also a 2D-versions (J=1) is computed.

A special case with KAPPA0 = 0 and opposite wall temperature = 1273.15 K
is computed to test the wall heat flux computation.
