To run the tests suite, all you need is (add the cmake options if you need any
or if the default libs and include paths are not the default) :

$ cmake -DBUILD_TEST=1 .
$ ctest .

If you like to run the tests against a installed GD library, set the following
environment variables:

export CMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH=/path/to/the/gd/include
export CMAKE_LIBRARY_PATH=/path/to/the/gd/lib

then call cmake using:

$ cmake -DUSE_EXT_GD=1 -DBUILD_TEST=1 
$ make
and finally:

$ ctest .

I will certainly add a nice CMake option to give prefix later.

What to do if tests fail on your platform and you use the last GD release? 
either from your favourite distributions or from http://www.libgd.org or cvs?

If you use a packaged version of the GD Library (installed from RPM, deb or 
ports, gentoo packages or any other packages format or distribution), please try
to run the tests using the source releases available at:

http://www.libgd.org/Downloads

If the tests fail using our source release, please report a bug here:

http://bugs.libgd.org

You can attach the two files available in:

./Testing/Temporary

Later versions will have an automatic post mode.

If the tests run successfully, please report a bug to the maintainer of the
packages (debian, bsd, ubuntu or whoever is responsible for the packages).

Reasons of failures:
Exception: SegFault: self explaining
Failed               test failed, check the log to know where
timeout              the default timeout is 5 seconds. Some test may
                     have infinite loops when compiled against old versions
                     of the GD library (esp. 2.0.33 or earlier)
