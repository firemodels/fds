The emissivity of the TEST surface changes due to the change in 
the mass fractions of MAT_A and MAT_B, having emissivities of 
1.0 and 0.0, respectively. The exact solution is a linear function 
going from 1.0 to 0.0 when time goes from 0 to 10 s.

The emissivity is measured using EMISSIVITY output quantity.
