<h3>Personal Background:</h3>
<p align="left">NAME: Brad Casterline<br />
  COMPANY: <a href="http://www.fsc-inc.com/" target="_blank">FSC, Inc</a> <img src="assets/images/external_link_icon.gif" alt="External Link" />  (Consulting Engineers) Kansas City, Kansas<br />
  OCCUPATION: Engineering Technician - Automatic Sprinkler Systems - NICET IV - Fire Protection Division</p>
<p align="justify"> For over thirty years I have been preparing shop and/or consulting drawings, hydraulic calculations, 
  and &quot;stocklists&quot; for approval and installation of sprinkler systems. I have not &quot;needed&quot; to know all
  the math and science behind CFDs to do my job, but, when two years ago, Ali, the head of our Codes
  Division, introduced me to FDS-SMV, I quickly realized how little I &quot;really knew&quot; about what I had
  been doing for so long. I became hooked, as it turns out, it is good that I did not have a personal
  computer at home at the time. My &quot;fix&quot; was reading all three Guides and all the examples several times
  before I started &quot;typing&quot; much. At night I would say &quot;Sure, OK, I get it now, tomorrow at lunch time
  I will do &quot;this&quot; and it will turn out &quot;that&quot; way&quot;. I was OK when it &quot;blew up in my face&quot; because it
  gave me something to do that night, to find out where I had not followed the Guide to the &quot;T&quot;.</p>
<p align="justify">Now while eating lunch I read the Discussions. I have learned a lot from this (except when the answers are
  already in the guides!). I have not posted any questions yet because:</p>
<ol>
  <li>I  learn more trying to figure it out first. For example, late last year, Randy, FSC-MEP (Mechanical Division)
    mentioned a project he was working on, a gymnasium with a glass wall. The Architect was concerned about
    condensation (on the wall and floor). Randy asked if FDS could handle something like that. I said  &quot;FDS can do ANYTHING&quot;! This gave me something to do for several nights. I set inside and outside temperature
    and humidity, sprayed water on a hot plate, tracked and directed the vapor on to the glass, and tried to pinpoint the time and conditions when the vapor condensed. I failed. Later I saw the condensation question
    posted- the answer was &quot;no&quot;, but I had learned how to boil water!, a lot about particles, glass properties,
    and all the applicable output quantities.</li>
  <li>    I have &quot;taken&quot; so much already, I wanted to &quot;give&quot; (no matter how trite) before I take more.<br />
  </li>
  <li>I have been unwilling to reveal my ignorance.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Submission Background:</h3>
<p align="justify">Just before last Christmas, Vish, a co-worker, sent me a link to a video of the new Mercedes Benz museum 
  in Germany- a high class smoke removal system using air jets to swirl the smoke out. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaazLTc0PCA" target="_blank">[Link]<img src="assets/images/external_link_icon.gif" alt="External Link" /></a> I was taking vacation
  between Christmas and New year so I thought it would be fun and interesting to see if I could &quot;make a tornado&quot;.  
  Maybe living in Kansas played a part also. I had not given much thought to VEL_T until then.  </p>
<p align="justify">I knew Bernoulli's principle-&quot;Where the velocity of a fluid is high, the pressure is low
  and, where the velocity of a fluid is low, the pressure is high&quot;. The change in pressure equals
  half the density times the velocity squared- (Bernoulli's equation). So I wondered, is the velocity higher at the top or bottom? I thought the pressure must be
  higher at the bottom, (to push the sides in to a point), so the velocity must be lower at the
  bottom. I did the input file-- it did not work. When I turned it &quot;up-side-down&quot; it did work. 
  I looked at some Z velocity slices thinking the velocity must be lower at the top,
  but the velocity was the same throughout- DUH!- if it was not, the &quot;particles&quot; would fly apart.</p>
<p align="justify">But if there is no change in velocity or density, there is no change in pressure. I thought I had gone as far as I could go- it was cool to look at and I know others figured it out<br />
  hundreds of years ago, but I was born and raised in &quot;The Show Me State&quot;, and am hard-headed. Looking at all 5 Z slices, I saw what did change, the AREA OF SAME VELOCITY increased from
  bottom to top. Since pressure is force divided by area, force is pressure times area- so I
  could see the direction and magnitude of a &quot;Force&quot;. </p>
<p align="justify">I showed it to a few people at work, my son, a friend, varied the background and species a little
  (BTW, HELIUM does not &quot;get it together&quot; with the current fan strength) and let it go, until I found out
  about the &quot;Simulation of the Month&quot; contest. (I'll bet that if there was a prize- say a mouse pad
  with the author's &quot;image&quot;- like the Haiku contest on Poetry.com- you would get a lot more entries :) ).</p>
<p align="justify">I input 100 fans at first, thinking I would have to vary the tangent direction smoothly- so the
  potential is there to &quot;sharpen&quot; the whirlwind. I wonder if it is possible to make it &quot;lift off&quot;. It might be a little far-fetched, but I can see the whirlwind going in one end of the multiple mesh
  diagram in the User's Guide and coming out the other! (I have way more ideas than the ability to model them).</p>
<h3>The &quot;notes&quot; page:</h3>
<div align="center"><img src="assets/user_submissions/hand notes.png" alt="Small Hand Written Notes Image" width="250" height="324" /><br /></div>
<p align="justify">Original Hand Notes: <a href="assets/user_submissions/hand notes.PDF">Hand Written</a> (.pdf) <a href="assets/user_submissions/clean notes.PDF">Cleaned Up</a> (.pdf) </p>
<p align="justify">This was not a pre-model concept. It was my attempt to fit Bernoulli's equation to the graphical
  representation of the calculations. I knew even if I was all wrong I would always see that force now
  making the &quot;particles&quot; of whirlwinds, twisters, and dust devils stand up. </p>
<h3>Final Comments:</h3>
<p align="justify">I cannot thank you all enough- it is incredible what a handful of people have created, make better,
  and maintain. When I saw FDS-SMV_5 was out, I printed all the documentation, came straight home from work, and
  immeadiately got teary-eyed with joy. I was &quot;expecting&quot; Thermostat and Beam Detector... but the Pressure Zones, Material layers, Multi-Reactions, Control Logic, etc., floored me. I thought &quot;this should have a name,
  not just the next number&quot;.... phiV ....?</p>
<p align="justify">Many, Many THANKS to all of you there at NIST/FDS-SMV and The Group,<br />
