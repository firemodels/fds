&HEAD CHID='box_burn_away_2D', TITLE='Test BURN_AWAY feature' / 

The FOAM box is evaporated away by the high thermal radiation
from HOT surfaces. The mass of the box is 1 * 0.4^2 m3 * 20 kg/m3 = 3.2 kg.
This should be compared to the final value of fuel density volume integral, 
computed by the first DEVC.

2D version of box_burn_away

The gas species is mixture fraction fuel.
