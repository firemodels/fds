\chapter{Preface}


This guide is based in part on the ``Standard Guide for
Evaluating the Predictive Capability of Deterministic Fire Models,'' ASTM~E~1355~\cite{ASTM:E1355}.
ASTM~E~1355 defines {\em model evaluation} as ``the process of quantifying
the accuracy of chosen results from a model when applied for a specific use.''
The model evaluation process consists of two main components: verification and validation.
{\em Verification} is a process to check the correctness of the solution of the
governing equations. Verification does not imply that the governing equations are
appropriate; only that the equations are being solved correctly.
{\em Validation} is a process to determine the appropriateness of the governing equations as a mathematical
model of the physical phenomena of interest. Typically, validation involves comparing
model results with experimental measurement. Differences that cannot be explained in terms of
numerical errors in the model or uncertainty in the measurements
are attributed to the assumptions and simplifications of the physical model.

Evaluation is critical to establishing both the acceptable uses
and limitations of a model. Throughout its development, FDS has undergone various forms of evaluation,
both at NIST and beyond. This guide provides a survey of work conducted to date to evaluate FDS.



\chapter{Disclaimer}

The US Department of Commerce makes no warranty, expressed or implied,
to users of the Fire Dynamics Simulator (FDS), and accepts no responsibility for its use.
Users of FDS assume sole responsibility under Federal law for determining
the appropriateness of its use in any particular application;
for any conclusions drawn from the results of its use; and for any
actions taken or not taken as a result of analysis performed using
these tools.

Users are warned that FDS is intended for use only by those competent
in the fields of fluid dynamics, thermodynamics, heat transfer,
combustion, and fire science, and is intended only to supplement the
informed judgment of the qualified user. The software package is a
computer model that may or may not have predictive capability when
applied to a specific set of factual circumstances. Lack of accurate
predictions by the model could lead to erroneous conclusions with
regard to fire safety. All results should be evaluated by an informed
user.

Throughout this document, the mention of computer hardware or commercial
software does not constitute endorsement by NIST, nor does it indicate that
the products are necessarily those best suited for the intended purpose.


\chapter{Acknowledgments}

\label{acksection}

Support for validation experiments and the preparation of the FDS
manuals has been provided by the Office of Nuclear Regulatory Research
of the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission (US NRC). Special thanks to
Mark Salley and Jason Dreisbach for their efforts.

Alex Maranghides oversees the Large Fire Laboratory at NIST where
these tests were conducted, and has helped to design the
experiments. Thanks also to technicians Laurean Delauter, Jay McElroy,
and Jack Lee who constructed and conducted the validation experiments
at NIST.

Rick Peacock of NIST assisted in the interpretation of results from
the ``NBS Multi-Room Test Series,'' a set of three room
fire experiments conducted at the National Bureau of Standards (now
NIST) in the mid-1980's.

Thanks to VTT, Finland, for their contribution of experimental data,
referred to in this document as the ``VTT Large Hall Experiments.''

At the University of Maryland, Professor Fred~Mowrer and Phil Friday
were the first to apply FDS to the NRC-sponsored experiments referred
to in this document as the ``FM/SNL Test Series'' (Factory Mutual and
Sandia National Laboratories conducted these experiments).

Also at NIST, Dan Madrzykowski, Doug Walton, Bob Vettori, Dave Stroup,
Steve Kerber, and Nelson Bryner have applied FDS to the reconstruction
of several real fire incidents that led to the death of fire fighters.

At VTT, Finland, Jukka Hietaniemi, Jukka Vaari and Timo Korhonen have
performed validation studies of various sub-models. The VTT Fire
Research group continues to work on model development and
validation of the model for various applications.

At the University of Canterbury, Christchurch, New Zealand,
Prof.~Charles Fleischmann and his students have provided an extensive
set of material properties of upholstered furnishings, plus performed
validation studies. Doctoral student Jason Clement spent a semester at
NIST validating the hydrodynamics of FDS against salt water data.

Several postdoctoral fellows at NIST have made contributions to model
development. Francine Battaglia studied the extension of the model to
look at fire whirls, Javier Trelles extended the large eddy simulation
technique to large, wind-blown fire plumes, Amy Musser considered
indoor air quality applications along with her advisor Steve Emmerich
of the Building Environment Division of BFRL.
