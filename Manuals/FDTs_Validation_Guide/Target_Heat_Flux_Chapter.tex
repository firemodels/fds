\section{Point Source Radiation Heat Flux}

The point source model assumes that radiative energy is concentrated at a point located within a flame~\cite{Beyler2:SFPE}.
Here, the point source is located at a point one-third the height of the flame.
The radiative heat flux, $\dot q_r''$, at any distance $R$ (\si{m}) from this point can be predicted using
\be
\dot q_r'' = \cos\theta \left( \frac{\chi_r \dot Q}{4 \pi R^2} \right) \quad \si{kW/m^2}
\label{eq:point_source}
\ee
where the $\cos\theta$ term (equal to $x/R$ for targets facing sideways, or $z/R$ for gauges facing upward or downward) accounts for a target that is at an angle $\theta$ from the source. The IOR orientation parameter is used to specify which direction the target or gauge is facing: 1 or -1 for the positive or negative $x$ direction, 2 or -2 for the positive or negative $y$ direction, and 3 or -3 for the positive or negative $z$ direction. $\chi_r$ is the radiative fraction~(-), $\dot Q$ is the HRR of the fire~(\si{kW}), and $R$ is the radial distance from the point source to the edge of the target~(\si{m}) and is given by
\be
R = \sqrt{x^2 + \left(z - \frac{L_f}{3} \right)^2}
\label{eq:point_source_R}
\ee
where $x$ is the horizontal distance from the point source to the edge of the target~(\si{m}), $z$ is the height of the heat flux target~(\si{m}). The flame height, $L_f$ (\si{m}), is given by
\be
L_f = D (3.7 Q^{*^{2/5}} - 1.02)
\label{eq:point_source_Lf}
\ee
where $D$ is the diameter of the fire source~(\si{m}) and is given by
\be
D = \sqrt{\frac{4 A}{\pi}}
\label{eq:point_source_D}
\ee
where $A$ is the area of the fire source~(m$^2$). The nondimensional HRR, $Q^*$, is given by
\be
Q^* = \frac{\dot Q}{\rho_\infty c_p T_\infty \sqrt{g} D^{5/2}}
\label{eq:point_source_Qstar}
\ee
where $\rho_\infty$ is the ambient air density~(\si{kg/m^3}), $c_p$ is the specific heat of air~(\si{kJ/(kg.K)}), $T_\infty$ is the ambient air temperature~(\si{K}), and $g$ is the acceleration of gravity~(\si{m/s^2}).
