The feature set and user interface for Smokeview is complex making it difficult to adequately test all of its features manually.  A scripting capability has been added to solve this problem. Many of Smokeview's features may now be run without user intervention through the use of scripts.  A script is simply a text file containing one or more commands.  Smokeview may then read the script commands and perform the actions listed. Some of these actions are loading data files, setting view points, setting times and most importantly rendering images.  By designing a set of scenarios and corresponding images that demonstrate Smokeview's feature set, one may test Smokeview running a series of scripts (one script for each test case)  and examining the resulting images to ensure that the fire model generating the results and Smokeview are working as expected.

This document then verifies that various Smokeview features are working as intended by presenting a series of   simulation results in the form of Smokeview images.  These images are generated using the various visualization features of Smokeview such as tracer particles, 2D or 3D contours, or realistic smoke.
