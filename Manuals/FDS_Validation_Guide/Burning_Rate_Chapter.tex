\chapter{Burning Rate and Fire Spread}

This chapter contains a series of validation exercises where the aim is to {\em predict} the burning and spread rate of the fire. Most of the simulations included in the previous chapters involved a {\em specified} burning or heat release rate. Here, the objective is to apply measured thermo-physical properties of the material and predict its burning rate, either with a specified heat flux or as a free burn.

\section{FAA Polymers}\label{sec_FAA_Polymers}

The U.S.~Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has studied various plastics that are commonly used aboard commercial aircraft.

This section presents measured properties of various polymers and the numerical predictions of their mass loss and/or burning rates under constant heat heating. Two types of experiments are considered. First, the NIST Gasification Apparatus is used to measure the mass loss rate of non-burning samples in a nitrogen atmosphere. Second, the standard Cone Calorimeter~\cite{conecal} is used to measure the heat release rate of materials in a normal atmosphere. When just the mass loss rate of a non-burning sample has been measured, FDS is run in ``solid phase only'' mode; that is, a 1-D heat conduction calculation is performed in a single grid cell. The result is the predicted mass loss rate as a function of time. To simulate a cone calorimeter experiment, FDS simulates the burning of a 10~cm by 10~cm sample with a specified heat flux to represent the effect of the cone heater. The cone itself is not included in the simulation. As the sample burns, FDS predicts the additional radiative and convective heating of the sample as a result of the fire.

In general, the burning/gasification rate of a charring polymer is more difficult to predict than a non-charring one because there are more parameters that need to be measured and
more complicated behavior, like intumescence, need to be considered.

\subsection{Glossary of Terms}
\label{glossary}

\begin{description}
\item[Assumption:]  Characteristics were assumed from known properties in similar materials.
\item[Cone Calorimeter] (ASTM E 1354 \cite{conecal}) The Cone Calorimeter exposes a small sample to a constant external radiant heat flux simulating exposure of the sample to a large scale fire. The device records mass loss data along with heat release data through oxygen consumption calorimetry. From this a variety of heat release related properties can be found including heat of combustion.
\item[Constant Volume:] The material is assumed to maintain a constant volume during the solid phase reactions.
\item[Direct:]  Direct measurement of densities is performed by measuring the dimensions and mass of the sample.
\item[DSC:] (ASTM E 2070 \cite{diffscancal}) A Differential Scanning Calorimeter precisely raises the temperature of a small sample of material at a constant rate. This coupled with knowledge of heat absorbed by the sample allows for the calculation of the specific heat function of a material as well as heats of reaction and phase change.
\item[Estimated:] Characteristics were approximated based on known properties in similar materials.
\item[FTIR:] Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy uses a spectrometer to simultaneously characterize the absorption of all frequencies of infrared light. In testing a sample is exposed to infrared light and a detector records light that has passed through the sample. A Fourier transform of detector measurement is then translated into absorption information.
\item[Gasification Apparatus:] Similar to the Cone Calorimeter however flaming is prevented. This is done typically through the introduction of inert purge gases.
\item[Inherited:] The properties of the product or component are assumed to be the same as the original material.
\item[Inverse Analysis:] Property was established by fitting a model to measured temperatures from the Cone Calorimeter or Gasification Apparatus.
\item[IS:] (ASTM E 1175 \cite{intgsphere}) An Integrating Sphere, or an Ulbricht Sphere, is a hollow cavity whose interior has a high diffuse reflectivity. A sample placed inside the sphere is exposed to incident radiation and reflectivity measured. Emissivity can be determined from this information. The standard above is for measurement of Solar reflectivity, and was not necessarily precisely followed.
\item[Laser Flash:] (ASTM E1461 \cite{laserflash}) In the Laser Flash Method one surface of a sample is rapidly heated using a single pulse from a laser. Heat sensors on the opposite side of the sample record the arrival of the resulting temperature disturbance. From this thermal diffusivity/thermal conductivity can be calculated.
\item[Literature:] Results were found within previously published literature.
\item[MCC:] (ASTM D 7309 \cite{microcc}) The Microscale Combustion Calorimeter (MCC)  rapidly pyrolyzes a milligram size sample in an inert atmosphere. The pyrolyzate is then exposed to an abundance of oxygen.  Heat release history is obtained from oxygen consumption. Similar to TGA with  heat release recorded rather than mass loss rate.
\item[Pulsed Current:] Can refer to different types of tests. Generally, a sample is positioned between two electrodes in a sealed chamber with an inert atmosphere. The sample is heated through pulses of current. Measurements of the sample and the chamber can give information regarding specific heat, emissivity, or other material properties.
\item[TGA:] (ASTM E 1131 \cite{thermalga}) In Thermal Gravimetric Analysis (TGA)  a small sample is heated at uniform rate, generally in a Nitrogen (N$_2$) atmosphere. The percentage weight loss of the sample is recorded relative to the sample's temperature. Rate constants can then be fitted to the data. Similar to MCC with mass loss recorded instead of heat release.
\item[TLS:] (ASTM D 5930 \cite{transline}) The Transient Line Source method records temperature of a single point at a fixed distance in a sample over time using a probe. Given knowledge of the heat exposure of the sample the thermal conductivity can be found from the slope of the recorded data.

\subsection{Non-Charring Polymers, HDPE, HIPS, and PMMA}

A non-charring polymer is considered one of the easiest solids to model because it typically involves only a single, first order reaction that converts solid plastic to fuel vapor. No residue is formed and the plastic is completely pyrolyzed. Table~\ref{FAA_Properties} lists nine parameters for each polymer studied. These values have been input directly into FDS, and the predicted mass loss rates are compared with measured values from the NIST Gasification Apparatus, a device that pyrolyzes the solid in a nitrogen environment to prevent combustion of fuel gases. The results are shown in Fig.~\ref{FAA_Polymers}. The exposing heat flux was 52~kW/m$^2$. A 1~cm layer of insulation was placed under the sample. Its properties are given in Ref.~\cite{Stoliarov:CF2009}.

\subsection{Complex Non-Charring Polymers: PP, PA66, POM, and PET}

The polymers described in this section exhibit slightly more complex behavior than those in the previous section because they exhibit foaming and bubbling as they degrade. Table~\ref{FAA_Properties2} lists the properties of each polymer.  In the model, the polymers melt to form a liquid with identical properties as the solid. The melting is characterized by a relatively fast reaction that occurs near the melting temperature with a heat of reaction equivalent to a heat of melting. The predicted mass loss rates are compared with measured values from the NIST Gasification Apparatus, a device that pyrolyzes the solid in a nitrogen environment to prevent combustion of fuel gases. The results are shown in Fig.~\ref{FAA_Polymers2}. The exposing heat flux is 50~kW/m$^2$. A thin sheet of aluminum foil and a 2.5~cm layer of Foamglas insulation underlies the sample. Its properties are given in Ref.~\cite{Stoliarov:FM2012}.

\subsection{Poly(aryl ether ether ketone)) (PEEK)}

Table~\ref{Properties_PEEK} lists the measured properties of poly(aryl ether ether ketone)\footnote{Trade name VICTREX PEEK 450G. The sample has been thoroughly dried.}. Its property values have been input directly into FDS, and the predicted heat release rates are compared with measured values from the Cone Calorimeter. It is assumed that the polymer decomposes via a four-step reaction:
\begin{eqnarray}
   \hbox{Polymer} &\to& 0.62 \, \hbox{Char 1} + 0.38 \, \hbox{Gas 1}  \\
   \hbox{Char 1}  &\to& 0.88 \, \hbox{Char 2} + 0.12 \, \hbox{Gas 2}  \\
   \hbox{Char 2}  &\to& 0.88 \, \hbox{Char 3} + 0.12 \, \hbox{Gas 2}  \\
   \hbox{Char 3}  &\to& \hbox{Gas 2}
\end{eqnarray}
It is also assumed that the gaseous fuel molecule is C$_{19}$H$_{12}$O$_3$. A 1~cm layer of Kaowool insulation was placed under the sample. Its properties are given in Ref.~\cite{Stoliarov:CF2010}.

The results for 3.9~mm samples at imposed heat fluxes of 50~kW/m$^2$, 70~kW/m$^2$, and 90~kW/m$^2$ are shown in Fig.~\ref{HRR_PEEK}. Note that the plots on the left are the results of simulations of the solid phase only, where the heat feedback from the fire is assumed to be 15~kW/m$^2$ and it is applied at the time of ignition. The plots on the right are from 3-D simulations of the solid sample and the fire. In these cases, the radiative feedback is not specified but rather calculated.

\subsection{Poly(butylene terephtalate) (PBT)}

Samples of poly(butylene terephtalate) (PBT)\footnote{Tradename Arnite T06-200, DSM Engineering Plastics} have been burned without oxygen in the Gasification Apparatus and with oxygen in the Cone Calorimeter. The properties of PBT are listed in Table~\ref{Properties_PBT}. It is assumed that the polymer undergoes a single step reaction that forms fuel gas and no char.

The results of the simulations are shown in Fig.~\ref{HRR_PBT}. Note that the effect of the flame radiation heat feedback to the sample surface is accounted for by increasing the imposed heat fluxes of 35~kW/m$^2$ by 39~\%, 50~kW/m$^2$ by 22~\%, and 70~kW/m$^2$ by 6~\%~\cite{Kempel:1}.

Black PMMA was chosen as the first material to be studied by the MaCFP Condensed Phase Subgroup. Its solid properties are listed in Table~\ref{NIST_PMMA_Properties} and its gas phase properties are listed in Table~\ref{MMA_Gas_Properties}. 

It is assumed that solid PMMA decomposes in two steps~\cite{Fiola:FSJ2021}.
\begin{eqnarray}
   \hbox{PMMA}_{\rm melt}   &\to& 0.98 \, \hbox{PMMA}_{\rm int} + 0.02 \, \hbox{MMA}_{\rm gas}  \label{PMMA1of2} \\
   \hbox{PMMA}_{\rm int}    &\to& 0.002 \, \hbox{Char} +         0.998 \, \hbox{MMA}_{\rm gas}   \label{PMMA2of2}

\section{UMD Polymers}

This section contains a description of seven polymers analyzed by J.~Li for his doctoral thesis at the University of Maryland~\cite{Li:Thesis}. In addition to the thesis itself, details of the measurement techniques can be found in Refs.~\cite{Li:IJHMT,Li:CF,Linteris:2,Li:PDS_2014,Li:PDS_2015}.

In the experiments, samples of seven different polymers were exposed to several different heat flux levels in the controlled atmosphere pyrolysis apparatus (CAPA) developed at the University of Maryland. This apparatus is similar to a cone calorimeter, but with a nitrogen environment. Thus, it is similar in function to the Gasification Apparatus. In each experiment, a roughly 6~mm sample was placed upon a wire mesh with no insulated backing. The top side of the sample was exposed to a specified heat flux, while the bottom remained exposed to ambient conditions. The mass loss rate of the sample was measured, and in the sections to follow the measured values are compared to FDS predictions. The seven polymers are organized into groups with one, two, or three degradation steps.

\subsection{One-Step Degradation: ABS, HIPS, and PMMA}

These three polymers are assumed to pyrolyze according to the following single step process:
\begin{equation}
   \hbox{Polymer}  \to \nu_{\rm r} \, \hbox{Char} + (1-\nu_{\rm r}) \, \hbox{Gas}
\end{equation}
The properties of the virgin polymer, the char, and the reaction kinetics are listed in Table~\ref{Properties_ABS_HIPS_PMMA}.

\subsection{Two-Step Degradation: Kydex}

This polymer is assumed to pyrolyze according to the following two step process:
\begin{eqnarray}
   \hbox{Polymer}       &\to& 0.45 \, \hbox{Intermediate} + 0.55 \, \hbox{Gas}  \label{reac1of2} \\
   \hbox{Intermediate}  &\to& 0.31 \, \hbox{Char} +         0.69 \, \hbox{Gas}  \label{reac2of2}
\end{eqnarray}
The properties of the polymer and the reaction kinetics are listed in Table~\ref{Properties_Kydex} and the mass loss rate comparisons are shown on the following page. Note that nominal exposing heat flux values of 30~kW/m$^2$, 50~kW/m$^2$, and 70~kW/m$^2$ were changed slightly in the simulations to account for the fact that the intumescing material surface moved closer to the heater during the course of the experiment~\cite{Li:PDS_2015}.

\section{Corrugated Cardboard}
\label{Cardboard}

Table~\ref{Properties_Cardboard} lists the measured properties of a double-wall corrugated cardboard with the conventional U.S.~designation 69-23B-69-23C-69. Corrugated cardboard is characterized by alternating layers of homogeneous, planar liner boards and corrugated sections made up of periodic flutes. The numbers in the specification indicate the areal density in lb/(1000~ft$^2$) and the letters indicate the flute designation (B indicates a range of 45 to 52 flutes per foot and C indicates a range of 39 to 43 flutes per foot). It is assumed that each layer consists of the same lingo-cellulosic, charring material with the density defined as the mass of the solid material divided by the volume of the layer. This representation requires slightly different definitions for the properties of each unique layer -- liner board (LB), C-flute layer (CFL), and B-flute layer (BFL).

The reaction mechanism for the cardboard material includes one reaction to describe the release of residual moisture and three sequential reactions to describe the thermal degradation of the virgin material to a final residual char. Each of the initial solid components (LB, CFL, and BFL) undergoes the same four-step mechanism.
\begin{eqnarray}
   \hbox{Moisture}            &\to& \hbox{Water Vapor}  \\
   \hbox{Virgin Cardboard}    &\to& 0.90 \, \hbox{Intermediary Solid} + 0.10 \, \hbox{Fuel Gas 2}  \\
   \hbox{Intermediary Solid}  &\to& 0.37 \, \hbox{Char 1}             + 0.63 \, \hbox{Fuel Gas 3}  \\
   \hbox{Char 1}              &\to& 0.59 \, \hbox{Char 2}             + 0.41 \, \hbox{Fuel Gas 4}
\end{eqnarray}

The gasification experiments were conducted in a modified cone calorimeter referred to as the controlled atmosphere pyrolysis apparatus (CAPA)~\cite{Semmes:IAFSS11}, in which the sample is surrounded by nitrogen to prevent ignition. Measured and predicted mass loss rates at imposed heat fluxes of 20~kW/m$^2$, 40~kW/m$^2$, and 60~kW/m$^2$ are shown in Fig.~\ref{MLR_Cardboard}.

\section{Wood Cribs and Similar Wood/Paper Combustibles}

A common combustible used in fire research and testing is a wood crib; that is, a uniform array of wooden dowels of nearly square cross section. However, a stack of wooden pallets can be viewed as a wood crib as well. Whatever its form, these cribs tend to burn at a consistent and predictable rate, making them ideal for fire testing.

\subsection{Aalto Woods}
\label{Aalto_Woods_HRRPUA}

Cone calorimeter measurements for 2~cm thick samples of spruce and pine under flaming, inert, and smoldering conditions are shown in Figures~\ref{Aalto_Woods_HRR} and~\ref{Aalto_Woods_MLR}. Water evaporates and wood pyrolyzes through their independent reactions, and in presence of oxygen, char residue from wood pyrolysis oxidizes:
\begin{eqnarray}
   \hbox{Water} &\to& \hbox{Water vapor} \\
   \hbox{Wood} &\to& \nu_{\rm char} \, \hbox{Char} + (1-\nu_{\rm char}) \, \hbox{Pyrolyzate} \\
   \hbox{Char} + 2.67 \, \hbox{O}_2 &\to& 3.67 \, \hbox{CO}_2
\end{eqnarray}
The parameters for the reactions are listed in Table~\ref{Aalto_Woods_Properties}.

The model for spruce estimated using the cone calorimeter measurements is employed in predicting heat release rates in an ISO 9705 room corner test~\cite{Sundstrom:1998}, and in a modified room corner test~\cite{Hietaniemi:2001} (in Finnish, English description of the test available in~\cite{Hietaniemi:1}). The selected test for simulation from~\cite{Sundstrom:1998} is M12, where the walls and ceiling of the test compartment is lined with 10~mm thick spruce timber. In the modified room corner test~\cite{Hietaniemi:2001}, the back wall opposite to the door opening, 240~cm length of an adjacent side wall, and a triangle shaped section of the ceiling connecting the two, are lined with 22~mm thick spruce timber. The gas burner is located in the timber-lined corner. All the other surfaces in the modified test, and the floor in M12~\cite{Sundstrom:1998} test are of concrete, as are the backing surfaces for timber.

For simulations of both room corner tests~\cite{Sundstrom:1998,Hietaniemi:2001}, concrete properties are assumed as given for lightweight concrete in~\cite{Hietaniemi:2001}: thickness of 20~cm, thermal conductivity of 0.1~\si{W/(m.K)} and thermal diffusivity of 2 $\times$ 10$^{-7}$ m$^2$/s. Assuming a specific heat of 0.88~\si{kJ/(kg.K)} for concrete~\cite{Drysdale:2011}, gives a density of 568~kg/m$^3$ from thermal diffusivity.

Figure~\ref{Aalto_Woods_RCT} shows heat release rates in room corner test M12 and in the modified room corner test. The burner output of 100~kW is reduced from both the experimental and simulation data, thus the figure shows only the heat release contribution from burning timber.

\subsection{SP Wood Crib Experiments}

These experiments and the modeling strategy are described in Sec.~\ref{SP_Wood_Cribs_Description}. Briefly, four piles of 1:4 scale wood pallets are positioned in a wind tunnel with various separation distances. The upwind pile is ignited and the fire spreads from pile to pile. The wind velocity for Test~1 is 0.3~m/s; and for Test~12 it is 0.9~m/s. For all others, it is 0.6~m/s. Tests~1, 4, and 12 have only a single pile; the rest have four.

Figures~\ref{SP_Wood_Cribs_HRR_1} and \ref{SP_Wood_Cribs_HRR_2} display the measured and predicted HRR for 11 of the 12 SP Wood Crib experiments. Test~2 was set up differently than the other experiments and was not used in the analysis.

\subsection{Aalto Woods Experiments}\label{sec_Aalto_Woods_Materials}

Table~\ref{Properties_Aalto_Woods_All} lists the relevant parameters for modeling the cone calorimeter experiments. The properties from the test report are simplified. Each multiphase property is represented as a single bulk value. In addition, the temperature-dependent thermal conductivity and specific heat are fixed at an average value. The ignition temperatures were calculated based on times to ignition at the lower heat fluxes using the other properties. The results of the simulations are shown below.

\subsection{FSRI/NIJ Experiments}\label{sec_FSRI_NIJ_Materials}

Tables~\ref{Properties_FSRI_Materials_Others} through \ref{Properties_FSRI_Materials_Wood-Based} list the parameters for modeling the cone calorimeter experiments. The properties from the test report are simplified in this analysis. Each multiphase properties is represented as single bulk value. In addition, the temperature-dependent thermal conductivity and specific capacity are fixed at an average value. The ignition temperatures were calculated based on times to ignition at the lower heat fluxes using the other properties.

\subsection{JH Experiments}\label{sec_JH_Materials}

Table~\ref{Properties_JH_Materials_All} lists the relevant parameters for modeling the cone calorimeter experiments. The published properties from the test report are simplified in this analysis. Each multi-phase property is represented as a single bulk value. In addition, the temperature-dependent thermal conductivity and specific heat are fixed at an average value. The ignition temperatures are calculated based on the time to ignition at the lower heat fluxes using the other properties. The results of the simulations are shown on the following pages.

\section{Compartment Fires}
\label{sec_Compartment_Fires}

This section evaluates the performance of FDS in predicting the growth of a fire in an enclosure for well characterized materials. Measurements and predictions of HRR in each test configuration are compared.

In the U.S., the NFPA 286 room-corner test is the common standard large scale test used to measure the contribution of interior finish materials on fire growth and regulate the use of interior finish in certain building occupancies. The room is 2.4~m wide by 3.6~m long by 2.4~m high, and has a doorway 2~m in height and 0.78~m in width. The lining materials are installed on ceiling and walls. A propane gas burner measuring 0.3~m by 0.3~m is placed in one of the back corners, in contact with the walls. The HRR for the burner is 40~kW for 5~min, and 160~kW for 10~min.

Many of these cases are in the NFPA 286/ISO 9705 room-corner configuration (or a modification thereof).

\subsection{JH/FRA Reduced Scale Compartment Experiments}
\label{sec_JH_FRA_Scaled_Compartments}

The Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) in the U.S. sponsored a series of small to intermediate-scale enclosure experiments to evaluate the impact of modern materials on HRRs in fully-developed railcar fires. The following pages compare FDS predictions of room-corner testing of scaled compartments.

\section{Wildland Fire Burning and Spread Rates}
\label{WUI}

The following sections present examples of fire spread through vegetation, both small and full-scale. Summary plots of burning and spread rates are presented in Figs.~\ref{Burning_Rate} and \ref{RoS_Summary}.


\subsection{Crown Fires}

This section presents the rate of spread for simulations of crown fires. For a description of the experiments and simulations, see Sec.~\ref{Crown_Fires_Description}. The experimental data consists of 57 observed crown fires. The simulations are performed with comparable conditions, but not all input parameters can be gleaned from the experimental reports. Thus, the comparison is largely qualitative, and has not been quantified in any way other than the comparison plot in Fig.~\ref{Crown_Fire_Plot}.

\subsection{CSIRO Grassland Fires}

This section presents the rate of spread for simulations of two of the CSIRO Grassland Fire experiments. For details of the experiments and simulations, see Sec.~\ref{CSIRO_Grassland_Fires_Description}. The first experiment, C064, was conducted on a 100~m by 100~m plot; the second, F19, was conducted on a 200~m by 200~m plot. The results of the simulations are shown in Fig.~\ref{CSIRO}. The fire front in the FDS simulations is defined as the location of the maximum gas temperature in a 1~m wide, 1~m tall strip along the centerline of the grass field. The experimental points were determined from aerial photography.

For each case, we perform simulations with three different fuel models---one using Lagrangian particles to represent the vegetation, one using the Boundary Fuel Model (BFM), and the other using Rothermel-Albini fuel models in a level set fire spread simulation.  For each fuel model, we also run at three different grid resolutions, as indicated in the plots in Fig.~\ref{CSIRO}.  The Lagrangian particle and Boundary Fuel Model require higher grid resolution $\delta x = [1, 0.5, 0.25]$ m.  The level set simulations are designed for relatively coarse grids, in this case we run at $\delta x = [20, 10, 5]$ m.

\subsection{USFS/Catchpole Experiments}
\label{USFS_Catchpole_Plots}

Figures~\ref{USFS_Catchpole_008} through \ref{USFS_Catchpole_354} present the results of 354 simulations of the USFS/Catchpole experiments. A brief description is given in Sec.~\ref{USFS_Catchpole_Description}. The paper by Catchpole et al.~\cite{Catchpole:CST1998} reports a single rate of spread for each experiment, which is depicted in the figures as a straight black line. The rate of spread of the simulations was calculated by fitting the best line through the fire position versus time over an interval between 2~m and 7~m from the ignition line, to avoid any edge effects on the 8~m fuel bed. Cases are terminated when the fire extinguishes, so some cases where FDS does not sustain fire spread have few or no observations over this interval.

With over 300 cases in this study, it can be difficult to evaluate the quality of the FDS predictions as they pertain to the different experimental parameters evaluated. Across the four types of fuel, the input parameters modified were particle surface-to-volume ratio (s), packing ratio (beta), fuel moisture content (M), and wind speed (U). The ratio of the FDS predicted spread rates to the observed spread rates are shown as a function of each of these parameters in Fig.~\ref{USFS_Catchpole_parameter_summary}.

\end{figure}

Additionally, neither Fig.~\ref{USFS_Catchpole_parameter_summary} nor the summary scatter plot in Fig.~\ref{RoS_Summary} include information on the cases for which FDS fails to reproduce a spreading fire. All cases tested have a reported spread rate from the experiments, so instances where FDS does not produce sustained fire spread are indicative of limitations in the current model representation. In order to guide future development efforts, Fig.~\ref{USFS_Catchpole_no_spread} attempts to summarize the model performance over the full parameter space. Gray points in the background correspond to successful spread predictions, while colored points in the foreground are those for which FDS does not sustain fire spread. This highlights problematic areas of the test matrix, such as zero wind speed cases with low values of packing ratio.

\subsection{Burning Trees (NIST Douglas Firs)}
\label{Douglas_Firs}

A description of the experiments and modeling assumptions are given in Sec.~\ref{NIST_Douglas_Firs_Description}.

Snapshots of the simulation of the 2~m tall, 14~\% moisture tree are shown in Fig.~\ref{tree_snaps}. The computational domain in this case is 2~m by 2~m by 4~m. The grid cells are 5~cm cubes. The pine needles are represented by 130,000 Lagrangian particles with a cylindrical geometry, or about 25 simulated needles per grid cell. The radius of the cylinder is derived from the measured surface area to volume ratio. Each simulated pine needle or segment of roundwood represents many more actual needles or segments. The weighting factor is determined from the estimated bulk mass per unit volume. The results of the simulations are shown in Fig.~\ref{NIST_Douglas_Fir_MLR}.
