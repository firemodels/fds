# notes:
# 1.  should only need "part 0" and "part 1" if a user is using the repo and does not have fds installed
# 2.  should only need "part 0" and "part 2" if a user is using the installed fds and is not using the repo
# 3.  except that INTEL_SHARED_LIB for installed fds may not be compatible with INTEL_SHARED_LIB
#     needed for installed bundle fds.  The solution is to set this variable when running qfds.sh .
#     The parameter #PBS -v seems to be the way to do this but I have not been able to get this to work.
# 4.  The variables MPIDIST_ETH, MPIDST_IB and MPIDIST are necessary until I figure out how to 
#     run fds on ethernet hardware using an infiniband openmpi
#

# to do:
# add the following commands to your startup file and customize for your environment
# try using just part 0 and part 1 to build and run repo fds then repeat using just part 0 
# and part 2 to run installed fds
#
# Let me know if you see any problems.  I've edited this file since I've tested it so there errors
# may have crept in.

#-------- part 0--------------------------------------
# variable needed for both installed fds and repo fds

# mpi library locations
export MPIDIST_ETH=/shared/openmpi_64
export MPIDIST_IB=/shared/openmpi_64ib

export MPIDIST=$MPIDIST_IB

# variables needed by qfds.sh when running fds
export FDSNETWORK=infiniband
export PATH=$PATH:$MPIDIST/bin

# set stack size

ulimit -s ulimited

#-------- part 1--------------------------------------
# variable needed when building or running a repo fds

# compiler location
export IFORT_COMPILER=/opt/intel17
export IFORT_COMPILER_LIB=$IFORT_COMPILER/lib

# Intel shared compiler libraries needed when running repo built fds
# (comment if using intalled FDS)
INTEL_SHARED_LIB=$IFORT_COMPILER_LIB/intel64

export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/lib64:$INTEL_SHARED_LIB:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH

#-------- part 2--------------------------------------
# variables needed when running an installed fds

# fds location
export FDSBINDIR=$HOME/FDS/FDS6/bin

# Intel shared compiler libraries needed when installed fds
# (comment if using repo fds)
#INTEL_SHARED_LIB=$FDSBINDIR/INTELLIBS16

# Set number of OMP threads
