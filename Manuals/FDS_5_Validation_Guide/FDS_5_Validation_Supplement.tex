\chapter{Preface}


This supplement to the FDS Technical Reference Guide is based in part on the ``Standard Guide for
Evaluating the Predictive Capability of Deterministic Fire Models,'' ASTM~E~1355~\cite{ASTM:E1355}.
ASTM~E~1355 defines {\em model evaluation} as ``the process of quantifying
the accuracy of chosen results from a model when applied for a specific use.''
The model evaluation process consists of two main components: verification and validation.
{\em Verification} is a process to check the correctness of the solution of the
governing equations. Verification does not imply that the governing equations are
appropriate; only that the equations are being solved correctly.
{\em Validation} is a process to determine the appropriateness of the governing equations as a mathematical
model of the physical phenomena of interest. Typically, validation involves comparing
model results with experimental measurement. Differences that cannot be explained in terms of
numerical errors in the model or uncertainty in the measurements
are attributed to the assumptions and simplifications of the physical model.

Evaluation is critical to establishing both the acceptable uses
and limitations of a model. Throughout its development, FDS has undergone various forms of evaluation,
both at NIST and beyond. This Supplement provides a survey of validation work conducted to date to evaluate FDS.
Documentation of FDS Verification is contained in the FDS User's Guide~\cite{FDS_Users_Guide_5}.






\chapter{Acknowledgments}

\label{acksection}

Support for validation experiments and the preparation of the FDS
manuals has been provided by the Office of Nuclear Regulatory Research
of the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission (US NRC). Special thanks to
Mark Salley and Jason Dreisbach for their efforts.

Alex Maranghides oversees the Large Fire Laboratory at NIST where
these tests were conducted, and has helped to design the
experiments. Thanks also to technicians Laurean Delauter, Jay McElroy,
and Jack Lee who constructed and conducted the validation experiments
at NIST.

Rick Peacock of NIST assisted in the interpretation of results from
the ``NBS Multi-Room Test Series,'' a set of three room
fire experiments conducted at the National Bureau of Standards (now
NIST) in the mid-1980's.

Thanks to VTT, Finland, for their contribution of experimental data,
referred to in this document as the ``VTT Large Hall Experiments.''

At the University of Maryland, Professor Fred~Mowrer and Phil Friday
were the first to apply FDS to the NRC-sponsored experiments referred
to in this document as the ``FM/SNL Test Series'' (Factory Mutual and
Sandia National Laboratories conducted these experiments).

Also at NIST, Dan Madrzykowski, Doug Walton, Bob Vettori, Dave Stroup,
Steve Kerber, and Nelson Bryner have applied FDS to the reconstruction
of several real fire incidents that led to the death of fire fighters.

At VTT, Finland, Jukka Hietaniemi, Jukka Vaari and Timo Korhonen have
performed validation studies of various sub-models. The VTT Fire
Research group continues to work on model development and
validation of the model for various applications.

At the University of Canterbury, Christchurch, New Zealand,
Prof.~Charles Fleischmann and his students have provided an extensive
set of material properties of upholstered furnishings, plus performed
validation studies. Doctoral student Jason Clement spent a semester at
NIST validating the hydrodynamics of FDS against salt water data.

Several postdoctoral fellows at NIST have made contributions to model
development. Francine Battaglia studied the extension of the model to
look at fire whirls, Javier Trelles extended the large eddy simulation
technique to large, wind-blown fire plumes, Amy Musser considered
indoor air quality applications along with her advisor Steve Emmerich
of the Building Environment Division of BFRL.
