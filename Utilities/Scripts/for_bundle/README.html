<h3>Setup if using an fds Repo</h3>
<p> The following variables are needed if you plan to build or run fds from a fds git repo.
Change definitions to match your environment.  For example, define MPIDIST_ETH or MPIDIST_IB to match
where your openmpi libraries are located.  Note, if you only need to define MPIDIST_ETH if you plan
on building and ethernet version of fds.  Same for MPIDIST_IB for infiniband fds.

<pre>
# set stack size

ulimit -s ulimited

# OpenMPI library locations
export MPIDIST_ETH=/shared/openmpi_64
export MPIDIST_IB=/shared/openmpi_64ib
export MPIDIST=$MPIDIST_IB

# variables needed by qfds.sh when running fds
export FDSNETWORK=infiniband
export PATH=$PATH:$MPIDIST/bin

# compiler location
export IFORT_COMPILER=/opt/intel17
export IFORT_COMPILER_LIB=$IFORT_COMPILER/lib

# Intel shared compiler libraries needed when running repo built fds
# (comment if using intalled FDS)
INTEL_SHARED_LIB=$IFORT_COMPILER_LIB/intel64

export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/lib64:$INTEL_SHARED_LIB:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
